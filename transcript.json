	" Right, so let's say you want to get started with this investing thing. You might have a bit of money saved, it's probably not enough for a house, but you reckon I should probably invest this in something. Maybe you've heard on the news about Tesla or Netflix or Amazon and how if you'd invested 10 years ago in Tesla, then you'd be investing air by now or things like that. But if you're new to the game, this whole investment thing can seem like a really complicated black box. Like how do you even buy a stock? What even is a stock? Do you just go on tesla.com and buy some Tesla? Like how does it work? And if you try and look into this, you get all these acronyms being thrown around like Roth IRAs and 401Ks in America or like I says in Lycels in the UK. And on top of that, there is the anxiety that we all have that I know investing is risky and I don't want to lose all of my money. So in light of all of that, this is the ultimate guide on how to get started with investing. It is the video I wish I would have had five years ago when I first started investing in stocks and shares. And we're going to cover this by thinking about investing in 10 different buy-size steps. So the first one is for getting about investing completely and just thinking what happens to my money over time by default. And if you've studied economics, you will know that your money loses its value over time. Thanks to something called inflation. Inflation is generally around about the 2% 2.5% mark and so that means that every year stuff costs about 2% more than it did the year before. For example, in 1970 in America, a cup of coffee cost to 25 cents. But in 2019, that same cup of coffee cost $1.59. That is inflation in action. And so let's say you've got a thousand pounds in your hand right now. And for the next 10 years, you just stash it under your mattress and you never look at it again. In 10 years time, your thousand pounds is not going to be worth a thousand pounds anymore because everything will have increased by 2% ish every year. So the value of your money will have fallen. And so if you put your thousand pounds under your mattress for 10 years, you will lose money over time and this is obviously not good. Even if you put your money in a savings account like these days, a savings account will give you like 0.2% interest, which means your money goes up by 0.2% every year. But because inflation is up by 2%, you're still losing money over time and again, this is not good. Okay, so that begs the question, which is key point number two, which is how do we stop our money from losing value over time? And the answer is that if we had a hypothetical savings account, one that was, let's say, an interest rate of 2.5%, that would match roughly the rate of inflation. So inflation means everything goes up by 2.5% in terms of price, but our money in our savings account also goes up by 2.5% each year. Therefore, we're technically not losing money over time. If you're watching this and you have an issue with the word interest, and don't worry, stick to it for now. Investment is not the same as interest, but we'll come back a little bit later. But the point here is that we don't just want to not lose money, which is what happens at a 2.5% rate. We actually want to make money and that brings us on to question number three, which is, well, how do we actually make money? Now, let's go back to our hypothetical savings account. If hypothetically we could have a savings account that was giving us a 10% interest rate. This will never happen because that's just way too high. But hypothetically, if it did, that means that every year we'd be making 10% of the value of the money in our savings account. So, for example, if I were to put 100 pounds in a savings account right now, the next year would be worth 110. And then the year after it would be 121 because it's 10% of then the 110. And then it would be 130 something. And this would very quickly compound. So that in 10 years time, my 100 pounds will have become 259 pounds. And if we adjust for inflation, then our money is still worth 206 pounds in 10 years time. This is pretty good. We have more than doubled our money by just putting it in this hypothetical 10% interest savings account. And it really doesn't seem like you would do that because 10% feels like a small amount of money. But if you extrapolate 10% over 10 years, you actually double your money, which is pretty awesome. Sadly, these hypothetical 10% saving accounts don't really exist because it's just way too high and real life is not that nice. These days, most savings accounts in the UK and I imagine around the rest of the world as well offer less than a 1% savings rate, which means you're actually still losing money over time. But we do have other options to try and get us to this magical nirvana of like, you know, this 10% saving thingy. And that is where investments come in. So point number four is what is an investment. And the answer is that an investment is something that puts money in your pocket. For example, let's say you buy a house for 100,000 pounds and you want to rent it out to people. There are two ways that's an investment. There are two ways you're making money from it. Firstly, let's say you're charging some rent to the people living in your house. Let's say you're charging them 830 pounds a month. That becomes 10,000 pounds a year. And so every year you are making 10,000 pounds in rental income, which is 10% of what you originally paid for the house. That means that in 10 years time you'll have paid off the 100,000 pounds that you put in because you're making 10K a year. And beyond that, every year you're just making 10,000 pounds in pure profit. So that's pretty good. But secondly, it's an investment because the value of the house itself would probably rise over time. In general, there is a trend in most developed countries that house prices tend to rise over the long term. And so your house will probably be worth more than 100,000 pounds in 10 years time. And in fact, in the UK historically, in the past, some people have said that house prices have doubled every 10 years. So maybe your house is worth close to 200,000 pounds. And so you've made money off of the rental income, but you've also made money off of the capital gains, which is what we call it when an asset increases in value over time. But the problem is that buying a house is a little bit annoying. You need to have quite a large amount of money for a deposit. You need to get a mortgage. You need to actually have the house. You need to sort out the rental management, rent it out to people, all of that kind of stuff. If only there were a way of investing without having a large amount of money to start with, and be without having to put that much effort into managing the asset as well. And that brings us on to investing in shares. And for me, basically, 100% of my investment portfolio is entirely shares. I have a tiny percentage in Bitcoin, and I own this house, but I don't consider this house an investment. I'll talk about that in a different video. Therefore, point number five is what are shares and how do they work? So buying shares is probably as close as we're ever going to get to this magical savings account that just returns some amount of money each year. And the idea is that when you buy a share, you are buying a pot ownership of the company that you've got the share in. For example, let's say that Apple have a particularly profitable year because lots of people have bought iPads as per my recommendations. And because Apple are feeling kind, they are choosing to pay out a dividend to their shareholders. So for example, they might say that they're going to issue a dividend of a million pounds, and that's going to be split evenly amongst whoever owns shares in Apple, based on how many shares they are. So for example, if you happen to own 1% of Apple, you would get 1% of that dividend that they've issued, so 1% of a million pounds, which is 10,000 pounds. Obviously, no one watching this actually owns 1% of Apple, unless Tim Cook you're watching. I don't even know if you own that much, because that would make you an extremely rich person, because Apple is a very valuable company. But that's basically how the dividend thing works. A company decides to issue a dividend as a way of returning some of its profit back to the people who have invested in the company, and therefore you make money through dividends. The second way of making money from shares is sort of like with houses in that you get the capital gains over time. So for example, let's say you bought 10 shares in Apple in 2010. At the time, those shares were selling for $9 each, so you spent $90 on buying 10 shares in Apple. As of October 2020, Apple shares sell for $115, so your 10 shares are now worth $1,150, despite the fact that you only paid $90 for them 10 years ago. Okay, so we've talked about what a share is and how you make money from them. And at this point, you've probably got a few questions like how much money you need to get started, or how risky is buying shares in a company. And I promise we're going to get to that. But point number six is how the hell do you buy a share in the first place? And this is where it can kind of get complicated because it's not as simple as going on Apple.com forward slash buy and just buying a share in Apple. It doesn't quite work like that. Instead, you have to go through what's called a broker. And back in the day, a stock broker was a physical person, usually a dude who you would call on the phone and say, Hey, Bob, I want to place an order for some shares in Apple. And then Bob would type some stuff into his computer or place like a paper order. And then you would own shares in Apple. Thankfully, these days we don't really have to talk to Bob because there's loads and loads of online brokers instead. And so you make an account on an online broker and then you can buy shares in a company through that. A bit annoyingly, every different country has the wrong different brokers to operate in that country because to be an online broker in a country, you have to abide by like a zillion different laws. And so in the UK, the system is different to the US, which is different to Canada and Germany and so on. In the UK, for example, most banks do have their own online broker-y type thing. So with most bank accounts, you can also open an investment account with them and then invest online. But usually that interfaces a bit clunky, it's a bit old-fashioned. And so you're usually better off going with an online broker. In the UK, the two that I use are Charles Stanley Direct and Vanguard. But before we get ahead of ourselves and make an account on Vanguard or whatever, we need to understand a few more things. And so question number seven is how the hell do I decide which shares to buy? And the easy answer to that is that you actually don't want to figure out which shares to buy. You do not want to buy individual shares. And I'm going to tell you a little bit more about that once I've had a haircut, so see you shortly. All right, so new hair. I've got my in-visaligned braces on, so I'm going to sound a little bit different. Wait, wait, wait. Oh yeah, we were talking about why it's not a good idea, generally speaking, to invest in individual stocks. And I'm going to do a video about this some other time. But essentially the issue with investing in individual stocks is it's kind of risky. Like, yes, if you invest in something like Apple, chances are it's going to be around 10 years from now. But historically, there have been quite a few companies that people were like, oh my god, this is amazing. This is the thing to invest in. And then that company went bust. So you're automatically exposing yourself to more risk if you are investing in individual stocks. Also, in general, like it's easy to say, hey, Amazon grew 10X in the last 10 years. Therefore, it's going to continue to do the same for the next 10 years. But that's trying to predict the future. And the past is no real indication of future performance. And so the advice that most people would give for beginners is that you should not invest in individual stocks. You should invest in index funds. And this is what Graham Stefan, one of my favorite YouTubers, also says as well. He says that index funds are the best, safest and easiest long-term investment strategy for most people, which begs the question point number eight, what the hell is an index fund? So there's basically two bids to understand here. There's the index bit and the fund bit. Let's start with the fund bit. And a fund is basically where investors will pull their money. So multiple investors would invest in the same fund. And then that fund would have a fund manager. And the fund manager decides which companies the fund is going to invest in. For example, let's say I were managing a fund and I called it Greengots. And let's say 100 people from my audience decided to invest in my Greengots fund. I as the fund manager can say, okay, the Greengots fund, now that we have 100 people's money, let's say is 100 million. So everyone's invested one million each. I've now got 100 million. I'm going to put 20% of that in Apple, 10% in Facebook, 10% in Amazon, 10% in Tesla, 10% in Netflix, 10% in Johnson & Johnson, all of that sort of stuff. And so you, the investor, don't have to worry about this because you trust me and my fund, the Greengots, to manage your money. And as the fund performs well, because the prices of these stocks and shares and creases, you get the returns. And I take a 1 or 2% management fee. So I make a load of money because I'm earning 1 or 2% off of this 100 million that I'm managing. And you're not worrying about having to pick stocks yourself. You trust me as a seasoned professional to do that for you. So that's what a fund is. Now the index bit refers to a stock market index. And so a stock market index would, for example, be the FTSE 100, which is the 100 biggest companies in the UK. Or the S&P 500, which is the 500 biggest companies in the US or the NASDAQ or the DAO. And these are all different indices of the stock market. And if we use the S&P 500, for example, these are the components of the S&P 500. So we said it's the 500 biggest companies in the US. So number one is Apple. And Apple makes up 6.5% of the S&P. Microsoft makes up 5.5. Amazon makes up 4.7. Facebook is 2.2. Alphabet, which is Google makes 1.5 and 1.5. So about 3% of the total S&P 500. And essentially, we've got these 500 companies. You go all the way down. Oh, Ralph Lauren is 496. But chances are you've not really heard of many of the other ones at the bottom of the list. But chances are you've heard of most of the companies towards the top of the list. So the S&P 500 is an index of the US stock market. And if you look at the performance as a whole of the S&P 500, you get a general idea of how the US economy is going as a whole. So this is currently what the S&P 500 looks like. And if we do a five year time horizon, in fact, let's go max. So you can see the S&P 500 started in 1980. And since that time, this is what the US stock market has been doing. So as you can see, there is a general trend upwards. But for example, in 2000, there was a bit of a crash. In 2008, famously, there was a bit of a crash. And earlier this year, when Corona was first starting to be a thing, there was a bit of a crash. But then the market basically immediately recovered after that. Okay, so we know our funders, i.e. a wave pooling money. And we know what indexes, like something like the S&P 500, when you combine those, you get an index fund, which is a fund that automatically invests in all of the companies in the index. And so with me, for example, basically all of my investments, all of my money is in the S&P 500, which effectively means that 6.5% of my investments are in Apple, 5.5% in Microsoft, 4.7% in Amazon, 2.2% in Facebook, 3% in Google, 1.5% in Berkshire Hathaway, and so on. So why is this good? Well, it's good for a lot of reasons. So firstly, index funds are really, really easy to invest in. A big problem that beginners have to invest in, it's like, well, how the hell do I know which company to invest in? How do I read a balance sheet? How do I do any of this stuff? If you invest in an index fund, you actually don't have to worry about any of that. Secondly, index funds give you a decent amount of diversification. There are all sorts of companies in the S&P 500, so you're not entirely reliant on the tech sector, or the oil sector, or the clothing sector, or anything to make the bulk of your money. You are very nicely diversified across all these US companies. Thirdly, index funds have very low fees. So because it's not a real person who is deciding, you know, what to invest in and doing all this research and trying to make loads of money, is essentially a computer algorithm that automatically allocates your money, you know, based on the components of the index fund. The fees for those are really low. And one of the main things about investing for the long term is that even a slight increase in your fees is going to massively impact your financial upside. And so for example, an index fund with a 0.1% fee is so much better for you than an actively managed fund where a fund manager is charging you even 1%. Because the long term difference between 0.1% fees and 1% fees is sort of absolutely astronomical over the long term. And finally, if you look historically, and technically historical performance is not the same thing as future performance, but if you look historically, a very few funds have managed to actually consistently beat the market, IE outperform the index. And in fact, someone like Warren Buffett famously says that if you gave him \u00a3100,000 and asked him to invest it right now, he would just invest in an index fund like the S&P 500. And in fact, in 2008 Warren Buffett challenged the hedge fund industry to try and beat the market. He said that hedge funds are a bit pointless because they charge way too high fees and they don't actually get the sort of returns they claim to get. And so he set up this 10-year bet which this company called Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners LLC accepted, where Buffett said that he was going to bet the index fund outperformed the actively managed fund and he ended up winning that bet and sort of gave lots of money to charity or something like that. But that just sort of goes to show that it's really hard to beat the market with an actively managed fund. Basically, no one can predict what the market is going to do in the future and therefore if you hit your ride on an index, IE, you're gambling on the entire market rather than thinking, you know what, I've got some kind of amazing insight that I'll know exactly which 10 stocks to pick that are going to beat the market. You might as well hit your ride with the whole market rather than individual stocks. Okay, so we've sorted out the problem of which stocks to invest in by completely circumventing the problem and instead just investing in index funds. The next big question people usually have about investing in stocks and shares is the amount of risk and that brings us to point number nine. And the argument usually goes as follows that, hey, okay, cool, this investing in stocks and shares stuff sounds kind of interesting. But my uncle Tom Kobli invested lots of money in the stock market and he lost a load of money and my parents have told me that investing in the stock market is a really risky thing and I shouldn't do it and I shouldn't instead invest in real estate because real estate is safe. That is usually the sort of thing, the sort of idea that people have about investing in stocks. And naturally there is the anxiety of what if I lose all my money. So let's talk about that now. So if we take a step back, the only way to lose money in anything is if you buy a thing and then you sell it for less than you actually bought it. Like let's say you bought a house for 300,000 pounds and then Brexit happens the next day and the house prices plummet and now your house is only worth 250,000. At that point, if you decide to sell your house, then yes, you are losing money and you've lost 50,000 pounds. Equally, the only way to really lose money in stocks is if you buy a stock at a certain price and then you sell it for less than that price. So for example, let's say you bought shares in Apple on the 18th of February 2020 and let's say you bought one share at which at the time was $79.75. And because this is your first time investing, you keep on looking at the price of the Apple stock because every day you're thinking, oh, have I made money, have I made money? And really annoyingly for you, you see that over the next kind of few days, a few weeks, Apple stock is actually going down. And then on the 18th of March 2020, you decide to screw it. I'm going to sell my one share in Apple because I don't want to lose all my money. And you sell it for a measly price of $61.67. And so you technically lost $18. Because you bought it at $79.00 in February and you sold it for $61 in March. Then you think, damn, I've lost 20% of my investment. This stock market thing is BS. I'm never going to invest in the stock market again and you call it a day. And this would be a very bad thing to do because, for example, if we look at Apple stock price in March, it was $57.31. But if you just held onto your one Apple share in that time, what is it today? It's the 8th of October. Apple is now trading at $114.96. So if you just held on for a few months, you would have actually made a lot of money. You would have bought it at $79. And within, I don't know, eight months, it would now be worth $115. That's a pretty good game. And so the real lesson here is that when you're investing in stocks and shares and also when you're investing in real estate, these are long-term investments. Ideally, you shouldn't be putting any money into stocks and shares that you need to access within the next five years. And actually, a lot of people will extend that to 10 years. And it's exactly like that with house prices. It's like, if you buy a house as an investment and then the house prices go down, it would be completely stupid of you to sell the house unless you are absolutely desperate for the money because something major has happened. And instead, if you just held on to the house, then you would have made more money in the long run because in the long-term house prices always go up. And in the long-term, basically, the stock market always goes up. And that's a bit of a, it can be a controversial statement. It is true, but I'm going to make a video at some other point explaining why it's true. But for now, take my word for it. That over the long-term, the stock market always goes up. But having said that, again, this is a long-term thing. And so, for example, if we look at the S&P 500, and look at how it was in 2008 at the financial crash, right, in 2007, it's $1500 per bit of the S&P 500. And then the crash happens, and then by, what is it? January, February 2009, it's down to 735. So basically, 50% of the value has been wiped off out of the S&P 500. Now, if you bought it in 2007 and you saw it, you know, you get a crashing and crashing and crashing. And then you sold when it was $800. Now you've lost a lot of money because you've bought high and you've sold low. But if you just held on, it took, so, you know, let's see, due to 2007 and that $1500, it takes about, up until 2013. So it takes about five years for it to get back to its normal level. And even if you had invested, like just before the crash, and then your investment plummeted by 50%, if you were just held on, you'd have bought in at the S&P 500, and right now it would be 3445. So since 2008, 2007 when you first invested over the last 13 years, the S&P 500 has more than doubled. So you would have more than doubled your money, provided you did not panic sell when the market crashed. Now, hypothetically, could the market crash down to zero and therefore you will actually lose all your money? Yes, it could, but if the US stock market crashed literally to zero, i.e., all the top 500 companies, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, like literally every company in the top, in the S&P 500, all of those got destroyed overnight, and the stock market crashed to zero. The world would be in some sort of mega apocalypse, and you'd have a lot more serious problems to worry about, rather than the value of your portfolio of stock market indices on Vanguard. In that scenario, in that doomsday scenario, money would stop meaning anything, and you'd be using money to wipe your bum, because money has no value, because the stock market has completely crashed. It's basically unfathomable that the global economy could be so completely wrecked, such that every single company goes down to zero. In my opinion, and again, I'm not a financial advisor, there's a technically not financial advice, whatever that means, but in my opinion, it's unrealistic to think that, if I put my money in stocks and shares, I could lose all of it. There's basically no way you're ever going to lose all of it, provided your diversified. If you invested in, I don't know, my space in 2001 ever it was, and then my space crashes, and then you've lost all your money, because they have no money. But if you invest in the top 500 companies in the US, or the top 500 companies in the world, or the top 100 companies in the UK, it is so vanishingly unlikely that you will ever lose your money, that I don't think that is a risk that we should even be thinking about. So realistic worst-case scenario, yes, investing in the stock market is risky in the short term, but if you're investing in the long term, the market will always go up, and you will always end up making more money in the long run, provided you don't have to take money out at inopportune times. Okay, so at this point, we've established that investing in stocks is very good, and investing in index funds is a relatively safe way of doing this. The next question is usually, when should you get started? Like, how old do you have to be? Is it ever too soon to start? Is it ever too late to start? And here, the answer is pretty simple, and basically, all investment advice agrees with me on this front. There's a very good website called the Motley Fool at Fool.com, and they have a nice article explaining this. Basically, you should start investing as soon as possible. It doesn't matter how old you are, it doesn't matter how young you are. The earlier you start investing, the better. There are three caveats, though, for like sensible financial advice. Firstly, you want to make sure that all of you high interest i.e. credit card debt is paid off, because when it comes to compounding, even though gains compound, loss is compound as well. And so if you've got like a 6% credit card debt, that's eating into your bottom line every single month, you want to pay that off as soon as possible. Point number two is that you want to make some sort of emergency fund, and people usually say that your emergency fund should have in cash, basically, three to six months of living expenses, so that if you lose your job, or if you're hit with some kind of incredible medical emergency, and you're not in the UK where medical care is free, or you're in the US or something like that, then you've got money to do that, and you don't have to take money out of your investments. And caveat number three is that you don't want to put any money into stocks that you think you might need to use in the next three to five years. So let's say you're 24, and you've just landed your first job, and you're thinking of getting a mortgage and buying a house, and you need money for the deposit. Do not put that money into the S&P 500 or into any kind of stocks and shares, because no one can time the market, and no one knows whether we might, you know, there might be a market crash tomorrow. All we know is that in the long term, the stock market goes up, but if you need to buy a house next year, there is absolutely no guarantee that that money will still be worth exactly the same or worth more this time next year. So it provided those two conditions on that. Like firstly, you have no high interest credit card debt, and secondly, you've already got your emergency fund, and thirdly, you're not planning to have a major expense in the next few years. At that point, you know, absolutely everyone should be investing something into the stock market, in my opinion, whether you're 12 or 20 or 21 or 22 or 50. It doesn't matter. And as they say on the multiple, there is almost no way your future self will regret making the decision to invest. And as you know, at this point, this is because of compounding, the more time you leave your money in the stock market, the more it compounds. And there is a huge difference. There's like lots of interesting numbers about this on the internet that people have calculated that if you start investing at the age of 20 versus if you start investing at the age of 25 or 30, it makes such a huge difference to your bottom line. That basically as soon as you watch this video and hear about investing, you should start investing provided those three conditions that we talked about. I met all right. So we're nearly there. Now we're point 11 out of 12 where we said, okay, you sold me on this idea of investing in index funds. All of these three conditions are met. I don't have a high interest credit card debt. I've got my emergency fund or I'm a student. And therefore my parents are in my emergency fund. And I'm not planning to buy a house or you're a big thing in the next three years. The next question is usually how much money do I need to get started with investing? And I know a lot of students watch my channel and I had a lot of comments on Instagram saying, I'm 14 years old and I don't have any money. How do I get started with investing? And the answer here is again, quite easy. Basically, start with whatever you can. So some of these websites and some of these apps that you can use to invest in stock market indices, you can start with as little as $5 or 10 pounds. Depending on the website, you might need to start with 100 pounds or 1000 pounds. You can research this and it kind of depends on which country you're in. But basically, you want to start investing as soon as possible. And it doesn't matter if it's a tiny amount of money to begin with. Firstly, it's useful to invest small amounts of money because compounding is always good. But secondly and more importantly, the sooner you start investing, the sooner it becomes a habit. And so for me, for example, I started investing in 2015. I knew absolutely nothing about it before then. But I really wish I'd started investing in like 2009 when I first had my first part-time job. Because A, that would have encouraged good financial habits within me. I would have kept aside maybe 10% or 20% from the top line to put into my investments. Secondly, it would have meant that investing became a habit. And so I would have known about the fact that stock market indices exist. I would have done research. I would have watched videos like this, although these weren't really a thing in 2009. And what I'm really annoyed about with myself is I started making actual money in like 2012 when my first business started to do very well. And between 2012 and 2015, I did not invest any money. Just because I didn't know that you could and I didn't know how. And I always kind of thought that, huh, I'm making money now. It's just sort of silly sitting in my bank account. And I know that inflation's a thing. So I know my money's losing value. But I just didn't think about investing and didn't realize how easy it is. And that it's a thing. And so I really wish I'd started investing my real money in 2012. But the only way I would have done that is if I had started investing from 2009 when I first started making, I don't know, six pounds an hour during my part-time job. So again, and I can't state this emphatically enough, like, it doesn't matter if all you have is a small amount to invest. Even if it's one pound, even if it's 10p, the process of making the account and researching online stockbrokers in your country and figuring out how to actually do this stuff is like the most valuable thing that you could be doing with your time immediately after watching this video. And finally point number 12 is, okay, I'm sold. I've got a hundred pounds here and I want to put it inside a stock market index fund. How do I actually do that? And the answer here is you want to find an online broker. So this will vary massively depending on which country you're in because these online brokers, as I said, have like, zillions of laws they have to comply with and financial regulations and all this stuff. In the US, most people that I know use Vanguard as well and my favorite blogger, Mr. Money Mustache, recommends that as well. Although in the US there are also other services like Betterment, which I've got a few friends who use that as well. Again, depending on which country you're in, like literally, all you have to do is Google the phrase, best online broker, Germany, or best online broker, Pakistan, or best online broker, India, whichever country you're in. And you'll find something, read some reviews. Basically, the thing you're looking for is you want to be able to invest in index funds and you want the fees to be as low as possible. I think Charlestowne Direct, the fee is 0.25%, which was the lowest at the time when I made my account. And I think is still pretty competitive. So you want the fee to be like a really, really, really small fraction of a percentage. Then once you've made your account and verified your identity and gone through all the hoops and stuff, which you sometimes take a few days and they send you a letter in the post to verify your address, like depending on what the regulations are. Once you've done that, then you can start just putting money in here and there. And all the friends that I've spoken to about this stuff over the last like four years since I first started knowing about investing in things. They have all started making accounts and sort of making these investment accounts for themselves. For the first few weeks, they all sort of compulsively check their phones to see what the stock market is doing. But then very quickly, you realize that actually I'm investing for the long term here. I actually don't give a toss what the stock market is doing the short term. I'm going to check my portfolio once every six months just because sometimes I'm curious. I don't even bother looking at it. This is very much a set it and forget its strategy. You're investing for the long term. Your money will magically grow over time provided you don't touch it and think, oh crap, the stock market's going down a bit. I'm going to take my money because I can't handle these losses. There's loads more to say about investing in finance, but hopefully this was a reasonably concise, not very concise. This is going to be a long video, but oh well. Hopefully this was a reasonable introduction to how to get started with investing in index funds. If you have more questions about exactly what to do or anything else about money, do leave a comment in the video description area thing. I'm still trying to think of a name for this series. I was thinking, I posted on Instagram, there were a few options. Money talks was quite a popular one, but that's already a film. One that I really liked was Penny Sillin. I think I might call the series Penny Sillin. That was kind of cool. A lot of people said like, finance she, Ali, financial she Ali, my name's Ali, get it? Financial she. A few different options. Let me know what you think. If you have any ideas for what this entire series about money and stuff should be called. And final piece of advice if you're in the UK, if you're in the UK and you're just going to start with investing, basically go on a hard drive's lands down and make a lifetime iso. The lifetime iso is a very good deal. You can read more about it on moneysavingexpert.com. Within the lifetime iso as 2020, you can put up to \u00a34,000 a year into it. And then you can invest that in the S&P 500, which is what I would do. If you have more than \u00a34,000 a year to invest, you can then put another \u00a316,000 into a stocks and shares iso, which I'd recommend doing with on vanguardinvestor.co.uk. And if you have more than \u00a320,000 to invest in a year and you're doing really well, then just open a general investment account with vanguard. This is what I do. I think it works great. Loads more links in the video description to other resources and bloggers and books and other videos that I would recommend. Graeme Stefan, amazing you should channel Andre Jik, does a good job with YouTube channels as well. Mr. Money Mustache, amazing amazing blog. J. L. Collins, amazing blog with a fantastic stock series that you should definitely read. There's so much to explore in this area and it's a really fascinating topic. But thank you so much for watching this video. Hit the video here if you want to learn about how I make the money that I used to invest. It's my video about how to make money online. Thank you so much for watching. Good luck with investing. Make sure you're new to invest in a stock market index fund and hopefully I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye.",
	" Usually when you're young you are a time billionaire, i.e. you have loads and loads of time but not much money. And then as we get older we get more and more money but we have less and less time and more and more responsibilities. So in this episode of Money Club, the ongoing series where we discuss the principal strategies and tools that can help us along our shared journey towards financial independence, we're going to go over the top five ways to invest your money and also the top 10 ways to invest your time that I would do if I were a teenager all over again. Part one, investing your money. Now the first most important point when you're saving money when you're young is please don't try and save too much. I know it sounds counterintuitive, everyone says you should be saving money all that kind of stuff but you definitely don't want to be getting to the point where you are sacrificing fun experiences for the sake of having an extra few dollars in your bank account. Like for example, let's say you're a teenager and you're living in the UK or the US, if you have 50 dollars or 50 pounds, that actually goes pretty far. It's going to be a big percentage of your monthly income whether that's from a part-time job or from gifts and things like that. And you can use that 50 pounds for a bunch of fun things like hanging out with your friends or going to the cinema or even going on dates or going on cool experiences, going backpacking, there's lots of stuff you can do with that money. Now the reason why we shouldn't save too much as teenagers is because as we get older, our earning power is only going to go higher and higher. And because we're going to have loads more money coming in, that extra 50 pounds is going to seem like a drop in the ocean compared to the money we actually make through having a proper full time job. And really as we get older are happiness from spending the same amount of money decreases significantly over time. So if you think about 10 years from now, it really won't matter to your future self whether you saved that 50 pounds, but the experience that you might have gone through hanging out with your friends rather than thinking I need to save this 50 pounds would have added to your bank of experiences just generally for a happier life. So really when you're a teenager, it's important to keep in mind that the best thing you can do for your future self isn't really to save that money, but it is to spend that money on cool experiences that you can then look back on in your memory bank. Right, so having said that point number two is that you should probably try and open an investment account. There's basically like a savings account, but if you put money into it, it lets you then invest it in the stock market and stocks and shares. Now I've got a whole separate half an hour long video, which is all about an introduction to investing in the stock market. So we're not going to go over all the basics over here, but that'll be linked up there or over there and down in the video description. If you want more of a primer about why and how you should be investing in the stock market. Now for example, in countries like the UK and the US, you do have to be over a team to invest in the stock market as an individual. And so what you need to do is you need to ask your parents or your guardian or whatever to open up some kind of investment account for you, like junior ISIS, like the call in the UK or custodial joint accounts that they call it in the US. It's going to vary depending on which country you're in. Now the point of opening one of these investing accounts when you're a teenager is not that you're plowing all your savings into it so that your stock market money can go up. Really the whole point of opening an investing account is so that you know what the process is like of actually putting money into stocks and shares. There are so many people I know who are in there sort of late 20s making good money but have never invested in the stock market, because it's always seemed like a mental barrier. It's like, oh, it seems so hard. And if they'd started doing it at a younger age, you know, even putting $5 in here and there, it just removes that mental emotional barrier from putting money into the stock market. So that's really the point of doing this when you're young, rather than thinking, hey, the point is to make loads of money over time. Right. So once you've got your investment account, point number three is that you want to invest some small amount of money in index funds. Again, I speak much more about index funds in my more detailed video about investing. But essentially, when you buy an index fund, like for example, the FITSEY 100, you are investing some amount of money in the top 100 companies in the UK. Or if you buy the index fund, the S&P 500, you are investing a little bit of money in the top 500 companies in the US all in one go. For most normal people, this is way better than trying to pick individual stocks. Like instead of saying, oh, I reckon Tesla's going to go up. I reckon Disney's going to go up because I like watching Disney Plus or whatever. You just diversify your money by splitting it between these top 500 companies. Now again, the point is not that that $10 that you're investing in the stock market is going to compound over time and make your millions further down the line. You know, it will compound and that is a good thing, but it's negligible compared to the amount of money you are going to be putting into investments as you start earning real money. But the whole point is that it just gets you familiar with the experience. It gets you into that investor mindset of when you have spare cash thinking, you know what, I can just chuck it into the S&P 500. I can chuck it into an index fund and not think anything of it. Whereas if you wait until you're 25 to do that, it's going to be a big, mental and emotional hurdle. So you should get over that hurdle when you're a teenager. So we're investing some of our money into index funds. I would recommend we also invest a little bit of our money into crypto. Yes, crypto. Crypto these days. Really interesting asset class. Interesting to learn about. Interesting to follow. If you want to educate yourself about crypto, there are loads of channels here that do that. I've got a video up there which is the basic introduction to Bitcoin. There's a chap called Paki McCormick who has a really, really good email newsletter called Not Boring. That'll be linked down below, which is a great primer on all things related to crypto. And again, I'm not saying put loads of money into crypto because you might lose it because there's still a fairly high risk investment. What I'm saying is put a little bit of money into it. Make an account on Coinbase. Link down below. Verify your ID. All of that jazz. Make an account in whatever crypto brokerage platform exists in your country. That is safe and reputable. And put a few dollars in here and there into something like Bitcoin or something like Ethereum. I'm about 50-50 split between Bitcoin and Ethereum. I don't really bother with like the altcoins or anything like that. I'm not a very sophisticated crypto investor. But I think it's sufficiently interesting that I put some amount of my kind of savings and my net worth into crypto. And again, the point is not that suddenly you're going to become a crypto billionaire and kind of money goes to the moon. It's more that you get an idea of what it's like to invest in this asset class and you educate yourself more about what it's actually like to invest in crypto and all the stuff around Web3. And really there's nothing like actually having skin in the game and actually having money invested into something like Bitcoin and Ethereum to really encourage you to explore it and take it seriously. And really the educational value of investing in crypto is why I'd recommend it for teenagers rather than money going to the moon or anything like that. Finally, if you still have a little bit of spare cash left after actually spending money on experiences and hanging out with your friends and stuff, I would recommend that you invest some amount of money into books or learning of some capacity. Now to be honest, when you're a teenager you probably know that you don't necessarily need to pay for a lot of things. There are ways to get books, basically any book under the sun for free on the internet and you probably don't need me to tell you that. Similarly software, similarly courses. Now I'm going to hold my hands up and say that when I was a teenager I was a bit of a bad boy. I'm not going to lie. I actually did pirate Adobe Photoshop back in the day. I'm not proud of it, but I now pay full price for it. And actually our team pays thousands of dollars a year to Adobe. These days I also, when I was 17, so 10 years ago, almost 11 years ago now, I pirated my first copy of The Four Hour Workweek by Tim Ferris. Come on, you're killing me here. Which was the book that most changed my life. Since then I have supported all of the stuff that Tim does through his sponsors and stuff so I feel less bad about it. But hey, you know what I'm just saying? Probably not morally good, but you know, you can make your own decision on that front. Alternatively you can go to libraries to get things. Like libraries are these incredible inventions where they just have books available completely for free that you can just like read. And that's amazing. Because then you can read books about like business and learning and entrepreneurship and all that kind of stuff that will help you out further in life if that's the route you want to go. But investing some amount of your money into learning would generally be a good idea. Part two, investing your time. All right, so let's talk about 10 different things that you can invest your time into when you're young. When you're young you generally have loads of free time and not much money. So really investing money is like a bit of a side hustle. Investing time is really where you can make decisions that move the needle for your future life if that's the sort of thing you're into. And tip number one is to build a fast lane mindset. And you should read this book the millionaire fast lane. If you don't want to read the book, A, you should. But I have got a video about it up there. And I'll link to the short form book summary of the book, which is also pretty good. And I'll link that down in the video description. But basically the book talks about, and genuinely it's sick. It's one of my favorite books about making money of all time. So 100% would recommend reading this if you're a teenager or even if you're not. And one thing he says in the book is that get rich quick is not necessarily a bad thing. Because get rich quick is what we're trying to do. Quick meaning in under 10 years. Get rich easy is the thing that is nonexistent. And anytime someone is promising you a path or a course or anything to get rich easy, they are trying to scam you because there is nothing to that. There is no easy way to get rich. But there are quicker ways to get rich than others. And they generally involve building a business. So you can read the book. You can educate yourself about the idea and kind of start thinking. Instead of this slow lane approach of get a good job, go to university, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, retire at 65. Try and think more around what can you do to build wealth in the short term by building some kind of business that provides large amounts of value to lots of people at scale. Tip number two for investing your time when you're young is to learn useful and in demand skills. Now even today, learning to code is still one of the best skills that you can have. I had dinner with a chap yesterday who learned to code, did a computer science degree at university in fairness. And now he's earning $750,000 a year as like a 27 year old, working for some tech company in the Bay areas. Absolutely absurd how much money software developers are making these days. I even know people who didn't go to university, like I've got a friend who left school at the age of 18, didn't go to university, taught himself how to code using the internet, and then got a job as a software developer within a year of actually teaching himself how to code. And I think was making 80K a year as his first salary, and that's just kind of slowly grown over time as well. And especially with all the stuff around Web 3 booming these days, like being able to code in something like solidity or being able to program stuff for the fear in blockchain or salon or polygons or all these other things that I don't particularly understand. If you can actually get into that world, and it's not that hard, there's free tutorials on the internet, there's YouTube channels dedicated to this sort of stuff. If you can teach yourself that stuff, that is a skill that's ridiculously high in demand, and you can use it to either build your own thing, your own little startup, your own product, your own Web 3 company, or you can be hired to someone else's thing, or you can join an early stage startup. There's so many options if you learn how to code. And honestly, if I was young, in fact, if I didn't have this YouTube channel, I would be spending all my time basically, even at the age of 28, learning how to code in solidity and becoming a Web 3 developer, but I've got this YouTube channel, so I'm more of a media person than a code person these days. Tip number three for investing your time as a teenager is to document your learning and your journey in some capacity. And the easiest way to do this is through writing. So this can be through a blog or through posting on Twitter, or writing on Medium, or writing a newsletter on Substack. There are all sorts of different platforms where you can document stuff through writing. But this is good for two reasons. Number one, it helps build the craft of writing and being able to communicate well through written language is also an incredibly valuable skill that makes you ridiculously valuable in the job market that also makes anything that you start and he business that you do more likely to succeed because now you're able to communicate whether it's writing copy for your landing page or writing sales page stuff, or even sending emails just being able to write competently and in a nice way is a huge competitive advantage. But the second reason why documenting your stuff is good is because it's really nice to look back upon. Like I've read so many books, like probably hundreds of books in my time so far. A lot of them when I was a teenager and a lot of them really changed kind of the way that I was thinking. But because no one told me I should start a blog back then or like document it in some capacity, all of those like learnings, all of those experience, all those memories are sort of lost in the void of my brain. And as we know, the brain is not a great device at actually recalling stuff because memories fade over time or that kind of fun stuff. So documenting your journey is good for your own personal memory bank. But there's a third reason, I forgot there were three. A third reason why it's kind of helpful as well. And that's that you might well build an audience of people who are interested in the stuff that you're sharing. It's pretty unlikely unless you really take it seriously. It's not something that like happens by accident. Most people who do it well are very intentional about it. But there's definitely the scope to then potentially build an audience of people who really enjoy your writing. And even if you're a teenager, even if you're 13, 14, 15, like whatever, there are probably people out there in the world who would be interested in reading about the stuff that you're sharing, especially if it's about documenting your journey through entrepreneurship or through learning cool things, anything like that. So that was the world of writing. But if you're interested in potentially making videos, maybe starting a YouTube channel, maybe doing a TikTok, maybe posting stuff on Instagram, YouTube is still pretty sick. That brings us to tip number four, which is to learn about video production. Again, this is one of those ridiculously valuable skills that all companies are now on the lookout for. Every startup I know is trying to do some kind of content marketing play. And so if you can educate yourself around cameras, how do you use a camera? How to talk to a camera potentially? How to edit videos, stuff like that. You again, have a massive competitive advantage if you're looking for one of these jobs in the future. Or also if you're trying to promote your own thing, which you might want to do at some point further down the line. And if you don't already have these skills, the best way of picking them up is by actually taking my own course on Skillshare, which is called YouTube for beginners. Skillshare are very kindly sponsoring this video, so thank you Skillshare for that. But I've got about 12 classes on Skillshare, and there's this new one that I've just released called YouTube for beginners. And that class is about four hours long. I think there's about 30 lessons in it. And it takes you step by step through how to actually build a YouTube channel from scratch, starting with like the concept, how do you talk to how to talk to a camera, how to set up a camera, how to edit videos, how to do thumbnails, all of that stuff. And that is a great introduction to all of the skills required to be a YouTuber, which are all the skills required to do the video production thing. Well, now the reason this is in investing your time rather than money is because if you're one of the first thousand people to hit the link in the video description, then you will get a free trial to Skillshare for a whole month. And in that month, you can take whatever classes on Skillshare you want. So you can take all of my classes, I've got like 10, 12 classes on there now, and this is absolutely loads. You can take my YouTube for beginners class, you can take my how to edit videos in Final Cut Pro class. If you want to learn more about video editing, you can even take my three productivity master classes where I share everything I've learned over the last five years around how to be more productive and how to get more out of your time. And on top of that, there are thousands of other classes on Skillshare covering all sorts of topics from business, entrepreneurship, like productivity, interior design, cooking, everything under the sun. There is a class for it on Skillshare. So if that sounds up your street, then do hit the link in the video description, sign up for a free trial, take my classes, I think they're really good, and learn about this video production stuff because it really will add value to your life in a really solid way. I hope if you're investing your time well. So thank you very much Skillshare for sponsoring this video. And let's now move on to tip number five, which is to become money literate. And this basically involves investing your time in learning and reading and watching videos about money to become more money literate and to educate yourself about this thing that's quite important to how we live our lives and how society runs. We've already talked about the millionaire fast lane, which is the best book I'd recommend on how to make more money. Next we have Die with Zero, which is kind of interesting around how to spend money. If you're interested in a sort of philosophical take on the topic, we have The Four Hour Workweek, which I've long talked about as being the single book that most changed my life and treated the way I approach my life and retirement and business and all that kind of fun stuff. We've got Your Money or Your Life, which changed the way that I approach my career. She's making like Vicky Robbins makes some really interesting arguments in it. I actually have a book club video about, actually I have a book club video about a lot of these, they'll all be linked in the video description. If you want to check them out, if you don't necessarily want to read the books. And finally, we have the psychology of money by Morgan Housel, which is generally a way to become more financially literate and to understand the emotional and often irrational mindsets and thought processes that govern our approach to how we spend money. And I've also got a book club episode about that, linked up there and down there, if you want to check those ones out. It's not just books, if for whatever reason you're unable to read, there are also loads of YouTube channels that talk about money in a really nice way. Graham, Stefan and Andre Jik are some of my personal favorites. But now let's move on to the second half of the tips on how to invest your time. And this is investing your time in gaining experiences. And so tip number six here is to get some kind of job or gain some kind of work experience. This is really helpful. A, generally getting a real job or some kind of work experience or a part-time job makes you some amount of money. I used to work for four pounds an hour or five dollars an hour teaching maths to people when I was younger. And it doesn't really matter what you do. The point is having that job gives you the identity of like, oh, okay, this is what it's like to actually spend some of my life energy to give some of my time to this thing and to get money in return. And you also learn a few skills along the way, like how to deal with colleagues and coworkers and how to have conversations with your manager. And these are generally skills that are very useful further down in life as well. Tip number two that I would say is to potentially do or make things for people that you admire completely for free. This is the idea of being a permissionless apprentice. For example, let's say that you admire an author or a YouTuber or a Tik Toker or something. If there is a way that you can create something for that person, maybe you take one of their videos and turn it into a tweet thread. Maybe you take one of their Tik Toks and you turn it into little nice infographic poster type thing. A, that helps you develop your own skills in using Photoshop and doing graphic design, in writing and all these other skills that are quite useful. B, it also helps you develop the skills in a kind of fun way because now you have a tangible output and you're actually potentially helping someone and C, it might even get you noticed by that person. There are a handful of people who, for example, with me over the years have been very, very helpful in, for example, we hired a guy recently to turn one of my tweet threads into this really cool visual, graphicky type thing and we hired him because we just saw his work on Twitter where he was doing this for other people for free. And we were like, damn, this guy's really good. So we paid him a bunch of money to do this graphic and that graphic did really well on Twitter. So, literally there are other people, some people who I now work with who started off basically cold emailing you being like, hey, I've created this thing for you for free, what do you think? And we're like, oh, this is awesome. I wanna hire you as a person. So basically there's a bunch of benefits in like, finding someone you like and like, creating something for them in improving your own skills and potentially getting you into their network as part of their network. Tip number three is a big one and this is to try and find a way to build a business when you're a teenager. So when I was younger, I had a little business doing web design and web development for small businesses and I was charging like $5 an hour, trying to undercut the market. But the skills that I gained during that are so much more valuable than the small amount of money I made. And it really helped me get into like, what it's actually like to work with a client, what it's like to pitch and sell my services, what it's like to negotiate stuff. And I was like, regaining all these skills randomly from the age of like 13 to 18. This is stuff that you don't learn in school. And so when I got to university and actually started my first successful business, I already had this sort of six years of experience through trying to make money through web design and web development stuff that I was selling to clients from all around the world. Back in the day, I used to use a freelance website called getercoderer.com. That's no longer a thing, but these days, Fiverr and Upwork and People per hour, there are all sorts of these different platforms where you can potentially find clients for the services that you want to kind of sell to them. And obviously you want to be good at those things. So this involves developing skills and then finding a way to sell your services in a way that adds value to other people. But broadly, it's a great way of building a little side business even while you're at school in the weekends and in the evening. Tip number four is that if you can, and this is actually quite hard, but if you can, try and find a way to turn your active income into some kind of source of passive income. So if you can figure out a way to create some kind of product or some kind of digital product or sell something that is not directly tied to your time, again, MJ Demarkett talks much more about this in the millionaire fast lane. That is really kind of the ultimate place to get to where you could potentially even be making money while you sleep. Something like starting a YouTube channel is actually a pretty good chat as well. And you can definitely check out my Skillshare class if you would like to, and I'd have to start a YouTube channel. But the great thing about YouTube videos is that anytime you make a YouTube video, once you're beyond a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time, so you get into the YouTube partner program. Every single video you make is an asset by itself. So for example, right now I'm investing time into making this video, but this video is gonna be on YouTube, well for the next several years, I hope, and people are gonna keep on watching this video two years from now, I hope, if the video's actually good. And so I'm gonna be making adsense money, even while I'm asleep. And therefore this video becomes a kind of passive income asset. I'm not saying that to make money on the internet, you need to do some kind of social media, you need to show your face, you need to debase yourself on the internet, like I've been doing for the last five years. You don't necessarily need to do that, but we just wanna be thinking more about like, is there some way I could kind of start out with some kind of active income source where I'm directly trading my time for money by offering a service, but then can I turn that into some kind of productized service, I kind of read something like the Millionaire Fast Name, or another really good book called Take Your Shot, or for example, the four hour work week, there are so many books and so many YouTube videos and stuff that break down the process of doing this. This is not that hard. I'm still surprised when I get emails and Instagram DMs and stuff from people who are being like, bro, can you give me advice on how to make money? Like, bro, the advice is already out there. All you have to do is go and find it and actually execute on it. There's no magical advice that I'm gonna give that someone's suddenly gonna put hundreds of dollars in someone's bank account. It's really about educating yourself about the process, reading books potentially, even if you don't enjoy reading, because books are incredibly useful value for money, especially this one, this one's absolutely sick. And then when you execute on that, A, you're developing your own skills, but B, you're also hopefully making money on the side. So that was tip number four, try and passivify your active income. And one of the best ways to get started with passivifying your income is tip number five, which is to try and dabble with outsourcing. Yes, this does require that you have some amount of money coming in, but if A, you've got a part time job, you've started making your own business, you've started selling your services on the internet on one of these freelancing platforms or through other people, you should hopefully be making some amount of money right now, even as a teenager. At this point, you want to be thinking about what is actually your realistic hourly rate? And is there a way that you could potentially outsource some stuff to people who are making less than that or that you can pay less than that amount of money? For example, when I was building my business at university, there was a lot of stuff that required a data entry, like taking stuff from previous exam papers and putting them into a database with permission or that kind of jazz, of course. But I wasn't gonna sit there copying and pasting stuff from like one PDF into a database. And so I hired this chap through Upwork who was charging $5 an hour to do basic admin and data entry. And I paid him for like several tens of hours to do this work, which would have otherwise taken me, tens of hours. And in a way, that was a way for me to passivify the active income that I was making by teaching courses and by helping people kind of helping people get into med school. Again, I'm not saying you're gonna make millions doing this, that's not the idea. The idea is that especially when you're a teenager, it's useful to develop the skill of what it's like to actually hire someone else. If you're a YouTuber, for example, what it's like to outsource editing, like what would that actually look like? If you're a business owner, what would it be like to work with a virtual assistant who helps you with emails and calendars and stuff? You don't have to do all of that kind of stuff, but it's just worth at least a dabbling in the space so you get some experience of what it's like. Now with all that said, and if you're still watching this, firstly, thank you, I hope you found this video useful so far. But the final thing to keep in mind really is that we don't wanna be thinking of these things as like sacrificing today for the sake of a better tomorrow. I think generally one thing that I've learned over the years is that it's really all about enjoying the present moment and enjoying the journey as we're going along. And if I think back about my web design career when I was from age 12 to age 18, I don't think about the money that I earned. And I never really saw it as being a sacrifice, but what I remember is the feeling of excitement that I'd get home from school and I'd be so excited to get back on the computer to see has anyone hired me for a project? Can I learn some more PHP stuff? Can I do some more tinkering with this online game that I was building? And that was such a joyful and exciting and exhilarating part of my life. What I didn't do was that I didn't feel like I needed to sacrifice anything in my real life to make that happen. A, I wasn't invited to many parties when I was young anyway, that might come as a surprise to some of you. But for example, if it was like, you know, some friends have invited me over to play PlayStation or hide and seek or something. Obviously I still do that because that's like the fun stuff. But rather than sitting at home and just watching TV, instead I got even more joy out of life by doing this web design stuff. So what I'd encourage you to do is not think of it as like, I'm sacrificing my free time right now for the sake of a better tomorrow so I can make more money. Instead more about thinking like, what are the things that I can do that I can develop and interest in? What are the things that I can do that I enjoy that energize me that are generally fun? So that even if I don't make any money, I'm still glad that I spent the time doing those things. And a lot of these 10 things that we've talked about in investing your time, you wanna find the ones that really fill you with intrinsic joy or find ways to make them more energizing and make them more fun so that you end up enjoying the journey and not just being fixated on the destination.

	" Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. In this video we're going to talk about the 5 biggest money mistakes that I made as a teenager, let's get into it. Mistake number 1 was being late to the investment game. So I only really started investing in 2015 when I was 21 years old, but I'd actually been making money through various side hustles and like a tutoring job and stuff since the age of 14 and I could have easily started investing when I was that age. Now we've all probably heard of something called compounding which is the idea that the earlier you start investing the more your money is going to grow over time. And this means if you start earlier then your money is going to grow like this rather than like this. This is compounding returns rather than linear returns. Now this is actually not the main reason why I wish I'd started investing earlier. When I was younger I really wasn't making that much money. I was making like $5 an hour doing some tutoring stuff. The mistake wasn't that I didn't put 20% of my paycheck into stuff and it would have compounded over time because really like when you're talking about small numbers like that the compounding effect isn't that important. But the reason that I wish I'd started investing earlier was that it would have built that particular habit in terms of investing. And when I started making real money around about the age of 19 when my first business that succeeded started to do it started to do well it took me about two or three years to get comfortable with the idea of investing because I was always like oh I don't want to lose my money. I don't know what accounts to make. Like what the hell is an isa? Like what even stock broker do I use? And if I'd figured all that stuff out at the age of 14 to 16 I would have been able to hit the ground running with putting decent amounts of money into my investments from the age of 19 onwards. But it took me an extra three years to sit around and wait for that to happen. Thankfully I did start investing in 2015 at the age of 21 and the money that I invested then has grown quite a lot since then and I've got a video talking about how much money I own to 2021 that has more details about that. But yeah that's one piece of advice that I would give to teenagers and also people in their 20s and basically anyone who has not yet started investing is that even if you don't have that much money it is still worth putting $10 into an investment account because then at least you have the accounts you've verified it you've given them your passport and staff to do all the jazz and you now know how to do it so that when you do start making real money you can then actually hit the ground running with investments. Mistake number two was spending money on really low value things. For example when I was about 13 years old I decided to buy a Dell Axim which was a personal digital assistant which was like like this pda type thing and that was basically like one of these organizers that like business people used to keep track of their outlook emails and calendar and stuff. I had no need for this but I thought I was like oh you know I'm a tech kind of guy I want to get a personal digital assistant and it was just a total waste of money and people at the time were like why didn't you just get a PSP and I was like no I want to be cool because I want to be like a business person organizer type guy. Now I'm also spending money on things if they're actually going to be worthwhile and so I've got a couple of rules that I now think about when it comes to spending money that I wish I could tell my teenage self. Rule number one is the law of diminishing returns. This law says that the more you have of a particular thing the less happiness you're going to get from that particular thing. So on this note anytime I make a tech review I always get questions from people being like oh should I get the budget iPad or the iPad Air or the iPad Pro or you know questions like that and my answer to that is always that it kind of depends on what you have right now and what you think you need because like there is a big jump from going to no iPad to having an iPad even if it's the budget iPad but then you get into massive diminishing returns if you want to upgrade even more money to the iPad Air or even more insane amounts of money to the iPad Pro. God forbid the iPad Pro 12.9 inch and so whenever it comes to evaluating tech I'm always in the back of my mind thinking about diminishing returns and thinking do I really need to spend like an extra X 100 or X 1000 pounds to upgrade this particular thing because it's probably going to be some diminishing returns on that. Rule number two is asking is there anything else that I would rather spend my money on? I've got two life changing pieces of tech that I think everyone should try and save up for its one point. One is a Kindle because Kindle is amazing because it helps you read more books and the second one is actually AirPods or one of those AirPods like devices that makes it that makes it much easier to listen to audiobooks and again I think if I were making the decision about should I upgrade this piece of tech into that thing or spend money on this I'd be thinking about okay is there a life changing piece of tech I could buy with this money instead or is there some kind of experience that I could buy instead which I'm far more likely to remember. Rule number three is I'd be asking myself do I really want this thing or do I think I want it because society wants me to want it and one interesting way of framing this is that if I were the only person on earth within reason would I still want to buy this thing. Now when it comes to something like an Apple watch the answer is probably not it's broadly a flex item that I buy because it signals something to myself and to other people but if it's for example a laptop I would buy it even if I were the only person left on earth because I'd be able to use it to create stuff or whatever. This example starts to break down because if I was the only person on earth then maybe that actually won't work out but hopefully you get the idea the ideas that we do buy things for signaling status to other people that is generally in my book not a very effective use of money unless you have too much of it and so I that is something that I like to keep in mind that I wish my teenage self would have kept more in mind do I really want this thing or am I just convinced I wanted because society wants me to want it and finally rule number four is do I really want this thing or do I just like the idea of this thing and this applies very nicely to my purchase of this ridiculous like Dell Axon personal digital assistant where the thing I wanted wasn't actually that what I wanted was the feeling of feeling of feeling important feeling like I'm a business person who has like stuff to do and businesses to run even though none of that was was at all true at the time and maybe still isn't like to this day I don't know but I was definitely in love with the idea of having a pda rather than the pda itself and I think I've made a similar mistake on a bunch of other things I've bought over time you know certain types of clothing I made some very like dubious clothing choices when I was in my teens and probably early to mid 20s as well and often it was because I liked the idea of having that piece of clothing rather than the piece of clothing itself so that's just another thing I wish I would have known when I was a teenager all right mistake number three was actually getting stuck in the cheap skate mindset for too long and we just talked about the mistake of spending too much money on things that actually don't make us happy that cheap skate thing is the opposite end of the spectrum where we spend two little money on the things that would potentially make us happier or would add large amounts of value to our life now firstly there's nothing wrong with having a mindset of frugality especially when you're young and you tend not to have that much money like that's more amount of money needs to go a long way and so it's totally fine to be very very intentional about the things we spend money on but at least for me even when I was making money I found that like it was hard to get out of that mindset of having to be frugal about all the things and I just didn't really appreciate the money value of my time so for example even when I was a teenager I probably could have made like five dollars an hour by offering my services as a web designer and yet I would spend like dozens of hours trying to find the cheapest web hosting on the planet or like a way to hustle a free dot com domain name even though like that thing that search took me like 10 hours and if I just paid for it it would have cost like seven dollars so I think I was kind of pretty out of proportion with spending large amounts of time and things rather than actually choosing to spend a little bit of money and I don't think this is a problem just for teenagers I think even when you're an adult and you start having a real job that makes you real money it still can be sometimes hard to get out of this frugal mindset for example I run a course called the part-time youtuber academy where places on this course cost between 1500 and five thousand dollars and there are hundreds of people that sign up every few months when I run one of these courses but it's always surprising to me because like often I'll recommend an app of some description when people are like oh well you know what app to use for this and I tell them what app it is and the next question they ask is oh is the app free as if they're they don't want to spend three dollars on an app despite the fact that they've paid 1500 to five thousand dollars to attend this course you know this this this this balance between using money well and saving money gets too much in the realm of saving money speaking of saving money I also strongly think that saving too much money as a teenager is a bit overrated and the reason I'm saying that is because when you're a teenager your earning power is gonna be the lowest that it's ever gonna be in your life like when you're in your 20s and you have a real job you're gonna own way more money than you could have ever earned as a teenager unless you're one of those like crypto millionaires and because of the law of diminishing returns that we talked about earlier if you spend let's say 20 pounds or 20 dollars the amount of happiness you would get from spending that 20 dollars as a teenager is way higher than it's gonna be in any other time of your life generally speaking of spending that same 20 dollars and so when it's a choice between do I really want to save just 20 dollars and put it in my savings account or do I want to have a nice experience with my family or with my friends I would generally air towards the when you're a teenager spend the money just have that experience there's not really that much value in saving the $20 caveat unless you need the $20 for your family or something better like that obviously that doesn't apply to you but in general for the most part I think teenagers shouldn't be too concerned about saving too much money and that's one of the problems with like all this financial advice you stuff where people are like oh my savings much money as you can it's like well actually $20 goes a long way when you're a kid and when you're not a kid $20 isn't actually that much again depending on your life circumstances and so if we break this down into two rules I think as a teenager you should spend rather than save if option one you've got future returns to that thing that you're spending money on so spending money on like education is actually very useful because there are probably future returns to that or option number two if you have something to fall back on again obviously if you're a teenager who needs physically needs that money to survive you don't want to spend it doing frivolous things but if you're a teenager and you're watching this video you probably do have some kind of safety net to fall back on like your parents and so if you have that strong safety net there isn't really that much point in saving large amounts of money when you're a kid again because your earning power is going to be so much higher when you're in your 20s and 30s so we've talked about money mistakes that I made when I was a teenager but one thing that I think I did really well was investing early on in skill development like back in the day when I was learning to code I would buy these like web design books and learn how to code from those and coding graphic design web design web development these are all skills that have really helped me over time and these days if you want to level up your own skills you in fact do not have to buy a kind of big ass bug that teaches you HTML but you kind of fact learn things on an incredible platform called Skillshare who are very kindly sponsoring this video now Skillshare is great for lots of reasons but my personal favorite reason is that I personally have like 10 different online classes available over at Skillshare which if you're one of the first thousand people to hit the link in the video description you can get free access for a one month free trial and you can watch all of my online classes on Skillshare most popular one that I've got there is about productivity it's about like my principal strategies and tools for being more productive I've got a very popular one that's very popular with students which is how to study for exams in an evidence based way and I've just released a brand new one which is YouTube for beginners so if you've been thinking of starting a YouTube channel or you haven't quite taken your seriously I walk you through step by step exactly the process I've taken to start a brand new YouTube channel with all the stuff along the way and it's really long it's very very detailed and it literally has all the information about getting started on YouTube in my head in this class ready for you to watch completely free of charge if you're one of the first thousand people to hit the link in the video description beyond my stuff on skill share which I love plugging to death there's also thousands of classes on all sorts of other topics my friend Thomas Frank has a really fantastic one about productivity MKBHD Marcus Brownlee has an amazing skill share original that breaks down his production process which I learned a lot from as well and so for basically anything that you want to learn skill share is the way to go number one start with my classes could I teach you lots of things and Skillshare completely free and number two you can like search and find these other amazing classes as well if that sounds up you'll straighten do hit the link in the video description and the first thousand people to click on that link will get a one month free trial to skill share isn't that fantastic so thank you very much skill share for sponsoring this video and let's get back to me from the past mistake number four that I made as a teenager was to buy things from unreliable sources so when I was 18 I decided to buy a MacBook Air it was my first Apple product I was going to become an Apple fanboy get into the Apple ecosystem and because I was trying to find a good deal I ended up getting scammed out of like thousand dollars of my life savings from this dude on gum tree which is like the UK equivalent of Craigslist and genuinely when I was that age I thought I was like invincible from getting scammed and I'd see all these like fake download buttons on websites and be like haha I'm not falling for that scam because I'm intelligent and I know stuff and and and and all of this but actually there's a bunch of studies that show that teenagers and really old people are the two groups that I'm I'm at like at the highest risk of getting scammed from stuff and I actually had a bunch of messages from teenagers over the last few years since I've started this YouTube channel from people being like oh my god I'm you know I'm such an idiot I fell for this crypto scam or I fell for this gambling scam and now I have no money and and you know that that that kind of stuff which is really sad to see but hey I've been there lost all my life savings because I tried to get a good deal on the laptop from Craigslist now there's a bunch of things I could have done to kind of mitigate the risk of that experience number one I could have used something like PayPal where there is actually buy or protection and it was a bit of a red flag when the guy was like oh I don't really like payment in PayPal I'd prefer to take payment and cash when you give payment to someone and cash like there's literally nothing you can do about it if they go run away with it and secondly I think I had a real fear of discomfort like had I been a bit more like taking my time with that whole transaction I could have inspected the laptop I could have been like oh this all feels a bit weird let me just take my time inspecting this before I like rather than handing over the cash whereas at the moment you know the guy seemed to be in a bit of a rush I was like oh I don't want to cause him too much of an inconvenience you know I was apologizing to him for making him come all the way to London to you know sell me this scam me out of this laptop like I had this real sense of wanting to please and I think I've realized that when you're buying stuff there's no need to have a sense of wanting to please it's still probably a problem that I have but like that experience when I was 18 really like struck home the idea that if I just taken a bit more time and run the risk of the guy being like a bit annoyed you know he was already in London like I could have I'd again just sort of not had that fear of discomfort stop me from examining the product properly and I guess rule number three that I'd say to myself is that I shouldn't buy things that I don't understand like I actually didn't research enough about the macbookare that I was trying to buy before buying it because if I had done if I didn't even an extra 20 minutes of research I would have realized that the product he was selling me was not actually the 2012 model of the macbookare it was in fact the 2008 model of the macbookare and that would have been abundantly obvious if I'd just done a little bit more research so the thing I tell myself is that especially when you're handing out large amounts of money don't invest or buy something that you don't understand similarly I wouldn't advise people to buy crypto randomly if they don't understand the underlying philosophy and kind of mechanics behind how crypto works and have a really a clear thesis for okay here is my conviction and this is my conviction as to how high crypto is going to be in the next few years and finally mistake number five that I made as a teenager around money was misjudging the dollar value of my time now when I was younger I used to do a bunch of freelance web design and web development stuff and my first few projects were for like five dollars ten dollars here and there and it was pretty amazing having that feeling of making money on the internet for the first time and thinking yes I'm going to be rich this is magical internet money this is fantastic but one of the mistakes I made is that like you know when I was around 14 I signed up for these two big web design projects where they were paying me like three hundred dollars to design this front end and back end and this enormous like custom coding thing that was needed for this big website projects and what ended up happening was these web design projects took around three years to complete and I got paid three hundred dollars for like three years worth of work times two and at the time when I first got the project I was 14 I was like oh my god three hundred dollars I've never seen that much money in my life and I signed up to do this like ridiculous sort of thing that was going to take hundreds of hours and then over the course of three years my you know the hourly rate I ended up with was like way lower than I would have got if I just flipped burgers at a McDonald's instead and so there's really two lessons from this that I would want to tell my teenage self the first one is something that I picked up from Tim Ferrissus four hour work week which is again a book that I wish I had read way earlier in 2007 when it first came out Tim says we need to distinguish between relative income and absolute income he writes that absolute income is measured using one wholly an in-all trouble variable the raw and all mighty dollar relative income uses two variables the dollar and time usually hours so suppose Jane makes one hundred thousand dollars per year she works 80 hours per week and 50 weeks per year this means Jane makes twenty five dollars per hour John makes fifty thousand dollars per year he works ten hours per week and like Jane fifty weeks per year so John makes one hundred dollars per hour so even though Jane earns twice as much overall John is four times richer when we factor in the time that he spends working in my case obviously when I took on these web design projects I was just thinking about the absolute income I was like oh my god dollar signs in my eyes like life is amazing and I had not at all factored into a kind of like factored the fact that this was going to take hundreds of hours of work to make these websites and the second lesson that I tell myself is something that I picked up from a chap called Naval Robocon who talks about setting an aspirational hourly rate which apparently he set at five thousand dollars an hour even when he was young and not really making very much money that's that's way too much money and his his theory is that you should just not do things that are making you anything less than five thousand dollars an hour that's probably a little bit excessive I don't think I would have gained much from following that advice when I was younger but what I like to do these days and what I kind of wish I'd done sooner is this idea of setting a realistic hourly rate like if I did an extra hour of work how much would my time be worth if I pulled an extra shift at the the tutoring center where I was working or if I did a little bit more web design type stuff and then just generally being aware of that dollar value of time especially if I was doing something where I wasn't also getting extra benefits like learning or like having fun I'm not saying that when I'm a teenager you know everything every single thing in my life needed to have been valued on this like hourly rate but certainly for stuff that I didn't already enjoy doing I should have been a little bit more like maybe I don't want to do this thing because the amount it's going to make me per hour is less than what I want that number to be so those are five of the biggest money mistakes that I personally made as a teenager and I hope that you won't make those mistakes but maybe you will and maybe you learn from them anyway if you want to hear more life lessons and check out this video which is 21 lessons for my teenage self and I'll be linked right over here thank you so much for watching do hit the subscribe button if you are already and I'll see you in the next video bye

	" When I was 12 years old I had this dream of making money on the internet. Now 13 years later and with a ton of failures and experience under my belt, I make over three times as much money from the internet on the side, as I do in my full-time job as a doctor in the NHS, the UK's National Health Service. This is the video I wish I would have had when I first got started. Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali and on this channel we explore the various principles, strategies and tools that help us live happier, more productive lives and we're talking about money in this video because firstly, more people should do it and secondly because money is such a massive source of stress in most of our lives. We often feel like we don't have enough of it and most of us trade more than 80,000 hours of our lives, a huge chunk of our short time on this earth to go to work so we can make money which we need to live. Being able to make money online outside of our day jobs is pretty cool. It means that if we're lucky enough to be doing a job that we love, then happy days we've got some spare cash to go on holiday with. But if maybe we're not entirely happy with working 40 to 80 hours a week, then we've got the option of going part-time or taking a job that pays less but that we enjoy more or even to stop working altogether if that's what we want. Now obviously this isn't an overnight thing, like it takes a lot of time and effort and luck to get to the point where we can quit our jobs and stick it to the man. But to be honest, I don't think anyone watching this would say no to having an extra few hundred dollars a month kicking around and the process of getting there isn't as mysterious as it can sometimes feel. So let's break it down. Basically there's only three ways, three legit ways of making money online but before we go there we need to talk about what money actually is. There's a poem from the early 1900s that goes as follows, Money is a matter of functions for, a medium, a measure, a standard, a store. And so putting this all together at its core, money is just a medium for exchanging value. Like we all use money to buy things that we find valuable and so if we want to make money or make money online, we need to be providing some kind of value that someone else is willing to pay for. So there's basically three forms of value that people will pay for over the internet and these are our three levels of making money online and that is level one services, level two products and level three attention. I've been doing variants of all three over the last 13 years. Like I started off, studying services as a web and graphic designer. I then moved towards selling products, so products for men school applicants and online question bags and now it's mostly through the attention that I've got on platforms like YouTube that I can leverage to superpower the sale of services and products and those are sort of the three levels of making money online. Level one, make money online by selling your services. This one's probably the easiest way of making money online. It's the one I've recommended everyone to begin with and it was how I got my start. There's only two things we need to do. Firstly, we need to develop a skill that people are willing to pay for and secondly, we need to find people who are willing to pay for that skill. Step one, develop a skill that others are willing to pay for. If you're thinking that I don't have any valuable skills, that's okay. You've got the internet and you can learn. When I was 12, I decided I wanted to be super cool and therefore learn how to code. Through using Google and finding a ton of free resources online, I taught myself HTML and CSS which are the basic and markup languages of websites and then because I wanted to make a video game for my nerd friends, I decided to teach myself PHP which is a service-side programming language and I did that in 2006 with just free information on the internet way back when all of these online courses and stuff were a thing so you can pretty much learn anything online for free. These days, there's hundreds of ways you can learn how to code online. I'd recommend starting with the basics of HTML and CSS by following random YouTube tutorials or by paying for something like code school or code academy and then trying to build your own personal website and if you want to learn proper coding, I'd recommend the introduction to Python course over at Brilliant who are sponsoring this video but I'll tell you more about them later. If you're not into coding, there are literally hundreds of services you can offer online. Like if you just look on the website's Fiverr or Upwork and browse their categories, there are literally hundreds if not thousands of different things that people will pay you for. Some of them are related to doing stuff on the computer like coding and websites and graphic design and illustration and stuff but there's loads of other things like writing and copywriting and data entry and being a person the system and admin services and just there's just like this whole world of stuff that you can do on the internet wherever you are in the world pretty much as long as you have a reasonable internet connection. Another easy-ish one to learn is video editing. If you want you can check out my Skillshare class on how to edit videos in Final Cut and after working through that you'll be pretty good. Like not having a monetizable skill is not an excuse anymore at all if you want to actually make money online because you can literally teach yourself anything over the internet and then you can sell that skill to other people. A step two, find people who will pay you money for that skill or service. Now there's two sorts of people who will pay you for your services essentially. There's eight people in real life or secondly people on the internet. I got started with people in real life. I learned how to make websites when I was 12-13 and then I sent an email to like my eight email contact and told all of my friends that I was going to be designing websites and I made this really terrible looking bano thing to advertise my services. I had my home phone number on it at the time. Don't worry it's not my home phone number anymore. We've moved houses many times since then. But I actually found like one of my friends's dads wanted a website built and so my first website that I made was this janky looking HTML CSS thingy that I made for my mates dad and he paid me 30 pounds for it so that was pretty solid. Alternatively and a much more viable long-term solution is that you can find people to pay you for your services over the internet. Now I got my start on a website called GetAcoder.com where you know people would post projects saying they need a web designer or a developer to do these various things and I would bid on those projects and say I'll do it for $10 I'll do it for $5 I would basically undercut everyone else in the market because I was like 12 13 and for me five or $10 was like oh my god I'm rich. These days this place is like Upwork and Fiverr that seemed to be the biggest ones and you can just kind of browse through all the different things people are looking for and then you can sell your services there you can say I'll do it for $5 or I'll do it for $10 I'll do it for $20 or $50 and over time as you get better at the thing you can start charging more and more especially as you start getting decent reviews and you start building up your own portfolio of whatever the thing is that you're doing and so I did this whole selling services this thing for a few years but I realized pretty quickly that ultimately what I was doing is I was trading my time for money and that's ultimately not very scalable model because obviously my time our time is limited and so if you really want to make money online then we want to get to level two level two make money online by selling products when you start selling products like physical or digital goods then your ability to make money online magnifies a lot because it's suddenly become scalable like it's not directly tied to the amount of time you're putting it now if we want we could sell pretty much anything online but the ideal thing that we want to sell is something that has a one-time cost of time of money to make but then we can sell infinite copies off and we want the cost of reproduction to be zero and ideally we want the cost of distribution to be zero and ideally we want the ongoing time commitment to be as low as possible so we can make the thing once and then we can sell it like a million times without having to spend much more time so the ideal product category then is digital goods or digital products now a digital good is anything from a website to an app or an online course or an ebook all of these things have a one-time cost of production a zero cost of reproduction zero cost of distribution and hopefully a zero cost of maintenance as well all right so we can either sell digital or physical stuff but obviously I think digital is it's better but there's basically two ways of selling it like we can either sell other people's stuff or we can sell our own stuff level two basic is selling other people's products now there's various different ways of doing this but just to simplify for clarity the two that we're going to talk about today are firstly drop shipping and secondly affiliate marketing let's start with drop shipping the basic idea is that we could make a pretty looking website that sells nice looking watches let's say for a hundred pounds a piece when a customer orders that watch we then buy it from a third party that's actually selling the watch and we arrange them to ship it to the customer so we're making fifty pounds without ever handling the watch at all now I've never really done this myself and I would recommend you probably stay away from it as well just because I've seen so many kind of online courses that seem to seem a little bit scammy about how you can make money online by drop shipping I also don't like the fact that drop shipping generally focuses on physical goods and as we've talked about physical goods are just not as fun to sell as digital stuff because you actually have to pay for it you have to arrange the logistics of the shipping it's just a massive bullick whereas digital products really are the way to go the second way of selling other people's products is with affiliate marketing now affiliate marketing is when you're selling someone else's stuff but you're getting a commission from each sale like there's a really good review website called Wirecutter and they do reviews about the best electronics in different categories and they have Amazon affiliate links so when someone clicks on that link and buys from Amazon then Wirecutter the website will make I don't know 1% 2% 3% commission on that sale and so if you get enough visitors buying enough things you can make a load of money from affiliate marketing or you can do what I do which is to have affiliate partnerships with certain products like there is the paper like screen protector who I've been evangelizing for the last two years because I genuinely love the product and so if someone buys a paper like screen protector for the iPad Pro using my link I will get some percentage commission on that sale and if enough people are doing that that can make a reasonable amount of money so that is how affiliate marketing works you're selling someone else's stuff but you're getting a percentage commission on the sale if you're interested in learning more about this there's a dude called Pat Flynn who runs a website and a podcast called smart passive income and they've got a load of materials that teach you the ins and outs of how to do affiliate marketing properly but selling someone else's stuff is absolutely fine but really we want to be getting to the holy grail and the holy grail is level 2 expert level 2 expert is when we're selling our own products if we're selling our own stuff then we control everything from the aesthetics to the price to the distribution to the logistics to the entire customer experience we are controlling ourselves so here there's kind of three broad categories of things that you could sell you could try selling physical products Peter McKinnon has done very well selling his camera bag Pat Flynn has done really well selling this switch pod which is a tripod for vloggers it's quite hard selling a physical product it's a lot of work you have to manufacture it distribute like logistics it costs a load of money I wouldn't recommend doing the physical products thing it's something I'm kind of looking into myself when it comes to selling merch but it's it's kind of hard and I think personally more trouble than it's probably worth secondly you could make a website or an app and you could sell access to that like for example let's say you make an iOS game or something and people buy it from the app store you're making money off of that or let's say you're making a website that's offering some kind of service and you're charging people a subscription fee or something for access to that service this is something that my brother and I did in 2015 we both know how to code and so in the summer of 2015 we built an online question bank for students in the UK applying to medical school taking these certain exams and so we charged people for access to the question bank and through the platform they could do the questions they could mark their answers right they could see solutions but the problem with this whole I want to build a website and make money off of that is that it's really quite hard in general you need to know how to code usually you want to find some co-founders you can go down the startup route this there's kind of so much stuff out there for essentially building an app that makes money but if you're a complete beginner to making money online the very first thing you should do probably shouldn't be to try and get rich off making an app so it's really very hard and it's kind of a more advanced way of doing things point number three is I think a much easier way that anyone can make money online and that is by selling info products so by info products I mean things like ebooks or digital downloads or online courses because if you can teach something and you can teach it in a compelling and interesting way online increasingly it's becoming easier and easier to find people who are willing to pay you for that online education you know more and more people are turning to online education so if you can teach something well you can make money off of that so with me for example I've got a series of online courses aimed at medical school applicants that teach them how to do well in these exams and medical interviews so that makes some money every week every month by selling online without me having to put any more effort in I've also got online courses over on Skillshare like a course on how to edit videos and a class on how to study for your exams and again those generate passive income i.e. I've put the effort into creating the course once and then is just selling itself repeatedly without me having to do much else and to be honest it's reasonably straightforward to develop the sort of expertise that then means you can teach the thing and I think a lot of us really struggle with this because we think oh I'm not an expert therefore I can't teach online but you can because if you're a beginner you can teach other beginners right now if you're thinking I want to make money online you could very easily sign up to a free trial of Skillshare and then you could watch my course on how to edit videos in Final Cut Pro and then you could make your own course for complete beginners on how to edit videos in Final Cut Pro like it's it's so easy you could literally learn anything online and then you can make an online class teaching that thing to other people and if you want you can sell it through your own website or if you want you can scale it through you to me course or a Skillshare there's all sorts of different platforms that you can sell your expertise on and as long as it's good obviously it has to be good because you know we make money online by providing value if it's valuable then people will buy it and you'll just kind of make money and it's pretty kind of magical system really but as you might be thinking you know we can make all of the digital products that we want the physical products that've gone on courses whatever the problem is we still need to find people who are willing to part with their hard earned cash to buy the thing that we're trying to sell them so how do we do that and that's when level three comes in. Level three is when we supercharge our money making powers with attention. Now there are ways that you can get your product in front of people whatever it is you could try running Facebook or Instagram ads you can go around knocking on doors in your neighborhood you can send a cold email to mailing list whatever you want but really the easiest way of selling anything online is by using attention and that's the attention of people who know like and trust you and by far the easiest way of getting people to know like and trust you is by providing valuable content on the internet completely free of charge. For example if you wanted to right now you could start a blog about productivity tips and every week you could write one or two blog posts sharing your favorite productivity tips from books from academic papers articles from podcasts from your own life and over time if you do this consistently and provide value because again this is an exchange of value we all care about value there's no snake oil that you can sell here there is no shortcut to making money online you're providing value for free across the internet over a long period of time and then in three years time you build up a mailing list of 20,000 people and now when you want to run your own productivity course you've got this mailing list of 20,000 people who know like and trust you from the value that you've given them for free over an extended period of time and now they're far more likely to buy your thing you've got an audience of people that you can sell to. There's a guy called Gary Vaynerchuk who you should definitely be following across every single social platform if you care about making money online and you haven't heard of him you know Gary Vaynerchuk loads of links in the video description he's got a book called jab jab jab right hook and the model for that is that a jab is like kind of a boxing analogy I think a jab is when you give someone content valuable content for free and a right hook is when you ask them for something or try and sell them something and he says an interview is that actually he wished he could have called the book jab jab jab jab jab jab like 25 times and then right hook but obviously he can't do that because it's a title of a book because that's the ratio that free content versus paid content needs to be you need to be providing 25 pieces of valuable free content for every right hook that you're launching every time you're asking someone to buy stuff and really this is the exact playbook word word for word that I've been following with this YouTube channel since 2017 I've been following Gary Vaynerchuk for years I've been following people like Tim Ferris who kind of modeled this perfectly over time by just flooding the market with a ton of really valuable free content not really worrying about trying to charge people for things and then later on you know once you've got this audience of people who know like and trust you hopefully you know through this YouTube channel I've managed to do that now for me if I want to sell a non-line course if I want to put a class on Skillshare I automatically have this audience of 600,000 people who are willing to hear my message and will be far more likely to buy the thing from me and so if you can build up that personal brand that professional reputation this this audience of people that know like and trust you at that point you are super charging your abilities to make money online because now you can sell goods now you can sell services and in fact you can even sell attention directly by doing sponsorship and stuff like that like I do a two-man audience of people that cares and there's just come that that's like completely an utterly life-changing when you've got this huge audience that you can leverage to make money online and in fact the audience doesn't even need to be that big like there's a load of podcasts you know my friend Noah Kagan runs one about marketing and he shows that even with a very small amount of people if you've got the right audience following you you could easily sell a product there's a guy called Kevin Kelly who wrote a famous essay ages ago called 1000 true fans where if you can just get a thousand people following you on the internet and those are your true fans those are the people that let's say you're a musician they're the people who will you know go to every show they'll buy the special edition of your album if you can get a thousand people who like you enough to potentially pay you a hundred dollars a year for the stuff that you make you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year you've got a full-time living from a thousand true fans and so the audience doesn't need to be that big but the way of building any kind of audience as Gary Vaynerchuk and Tim Ferrissay is to just produce a ton of really valuable free content over a long period of time but Ali if I give away content for free people won't buy my paid stuff that's not how it works people will buy your paid stuff but only if you give them content for free you don't build an audience by selling them stuff you build an audience by giving them a load of stuff for free and then you can sell to them three years down the line and so for me right now I'm at the point with passive income where I make so much more money on the side through these online activities through selling good services and attention online then I do my day job of working 60 hours a week of being a doctor in the UK. Now honestly all of this started 13 years ago when I decided that I wanted to be a super nerd and learn how to code and so if you're watching this right now and you're thinking that you want to maybe start this journey one thing that I'd really recommend is that you learn how to code yes in this day and age you don't absolutely have to learn how to code but it's it's the sort of thing that really helps if you're trying to sell any kind of kind of software product online and honestly the best place that I'd recommend you learning how to code is firstly teach yourself HTML and CSS using random free tutorials on YouTube you can learn HTML in a single day you can learn CSS in two days and then you can try building your own personal website and then once you've done that you should definitely go over to Brilliant for their online course on learning Python and the fundamentals of computer science brilliant I kindly sponsoring this video there are fantastic online platform for maths science and computer science courses and their introduction to Python and also they're kind of advanced Python courses are really good at learning Python which is the world's most popular programming language and with Python you can do anything from making an app to making a website to making even a question bank that you know gives people access to med school questions which is sort of the thing that me and my brother did so if that sounds good you should head over to brilliant.org forward slash Ali and the first 200 people to click on that link will get 20% of the annual premium subscription but yeah those were the three levels of making money online if you're interested in learning more I put together a playlist for you right here that has a lot of my other videos about how to make money online to watch those read the books that I recommend and then I promise you'll start on your path to you know getting rich by making money on the internet so thank you for watching and see you in the next video.",
	" Hey friends welcome back to the channel. In this video we're going to talk about nine different ways that you can make passive income. And for each of those I'm going to talk about how hard it is to get started, how hard it is to make a hundred dollars a month from it, and how harder it is to maintain once you've created the thing in the first place. For me and my business these nine different sources generate around 27,000 dollars per week these days with varying degrees of passiveness. And obviously this has taken me like eight years to build up so don't expect to be hitting those sorts of numbers when you first get started. But this is the video that I wish I would have had when I started my financial independence journey many many years ago. Let's go for it. All right so when I say passive income I always air quote it because there is really no such thing as passive income. There is no way to make money without doing anything at all. But when I say passive income what I mean is that it's money that is not directly tied to our time. So let's say you were to write a book. If you write a book you publish a book that book is now in bookshelves. You've done the work kind of once to write and publish the book. But now anytime the book sells you make money from royalties that is passive income. You could literally be making money while you sleep because you've created this thing which is out in the world which is generating income for you. The other thing with passive income is that it always takes a very long time to get going. So if you see any ads before this video talking about how you can get rich quick by whatever scheme or if you see people in the comments pretending to be me saying oh my god here's how you can get rich quick with crypto. What's up this number? That is all a scam. It's not going to work. There is no way to get rich quick. It is not a thing. So if you're looking for a get rich quick scheme those things just don't exist. So you might as well not even try. And the way I think of this is that ultimately money is just a medium for exchanging value. The only way to make money is to provide value. And the only way to make passive income, passive money is to provide value in a way that is not directly tied to your time. So please please please do not try and join a get rich quick scheme. They don't exist. I've had lots of messages over their years from people who have tried signing up to a get rich quick crypto scheme or a gambling scheme or a hey here is how you kind of play poker online. None of these things ever work. People always end up losing money. The only way to make money is by providing value. And so let's talk about the nine different ways that you could provide value if you wanted to. Just before we dive in I want to tell you that I've just launched my brand new Skillshare class about productivity for creators how to start a successful side hustle. That's linked in the video description. Skillshare sponsoring this video I'll tell you more about Skillshare later on but I want to plug my own class because I think it's genuinely really good and people really like it and it'll help you get tips on how you can start side hustles in your spare time. Anyway let's get into the video. All right so let's kick things off with investing in stocks and shares and in this context the way that we provide value is by offering up our money. Providing money and investing in a service is in a way giving a form of value and so when we give our money to a company in the form of buying their stocks it makes sense that we would get some kind of return for that investment. And we're starting with this because investing in stocks is the easiest way to make any kind of passive income. If you have any sorts of savings and they're sitting in a savings account earning 0.01% interest they're not really doing very much for you whereas if you had those days savings and put them in stocks you could potentially be earning passive income from the money that's otherwise just sitting there. Now I've got a whole video called the ultimate guide to investing in stocks and shares for beginners which is going to be linked over there somewhere so that is a solid half an hour long introduction to stocks and exactly how they work but the thing that I recommend for most beginners as a non-financial advisor and this is not financial advice purely for entertainment purposes only or so people say or at least the thing that I do is that basically all my money that's in stocks and shares is invested in index funds. Now an index fund is something like the S&P 500 and when you invest let's say a thousand dollars in the S&P 500 that basically means that your thousand dollars is distributed amongst the top 500 biggest companies in the US so you know weighted by how big they are so like you know 2% of it would be an app hold 2% in Facebook 2% in Google 2% in Microsoft and then you probably want to have heard of the 500th company on the list but basically all the big US companies you've heard of you end up investing in all of them a little bit at a time. So if you want to get started with that all you need to do is sign up to a stockbroker if you're in the US you can use Weeball I think I've got a link in the description if you're in the UK you can use free trade or Vanguard basically whatever country you're in just Google the phrase best stockbroker platform your country name and you'll find something that works for you and then it's very easy to be able to invest in an index fund. So within our famous side hustle assessment matrix we're going to give the difficulty of starting a one star rating one out of five it's very very easy to get started with stocks how hard is it to make a hundred dollars a month by investing in stocks and shares well this kind of depends because it depends on the performance of the stock market overall so in the last 12 months from 2020 to 2021 the S&P 500 is actually increased by about 50% that is that is a lot it's like gone up by a solid 50% despite COVID and everything going on. So if in April 2020 you had invested $2,400 in the S&P 500 the fact that it's gone up by 50% means you would have made a hundred dollars a month but obviously this is not the way to look at it because you know things can go up and down and the stock market has different levels of performance depending on what time period you're looking at but if we average out the last 30 to 50 years the S&P 500 has had a roughly 10.0% return which means every year on average over the long term it goes up by around 10% this is not inflation adjusted for any economist among us and so if we do some back-of-the-envelope calculations if we want to earn a hundred dollars a month passively through stocks and shares we would need around about 12,000 dollars invested in the S&P 500 to make that 10% $1,200 a year which is $100 a month but as I talk about in that video about stocks over time we have compounding and so if you put in $7,500 in the S&P 500 and you left it there for five years then five years later you would be making roughly a hundred dollars a month if we go by this very average figure of 10% a year or if you invested $5,000 in the S&P 500 then 10 years later you'd be making a hundred dollars a month in purely passive income again assuming the 10% average so overall how hard is it really to make a hundred dollars a month in passive income from stocks and shares well it kind of just depends on how hard is it for you to make $5,000 $7,500 or $12,000 in savings and put them into a stock market index fund and crucially this is money that you shouldn't need to touch in the next five to ten years at least so basically how easy is it for you to make that sort of money obviously varies massively depending on which country you're in and what your circumstances are and what your job is but if you're in the UK or the US where the median average salary is around about $50,000 something like that then depending on your circumstances it's not that hard to get $10,000 in savings obviously if you're supporting a family of 15 people on $50,000 it's different if you're a single person again it's different but I'm going to give this roughly a three out of five star rating for difficulty of getting a hundred dollars a month obviously if you live in a country like India where the average salary is $3,600 a year it's very very difficult to make $10,000 in savings overall and finally the third category in our side hustle assessment matrix is how hard is it to maintain this income once you've set it up in the first place and we're going to give this a one star out of five because once you've got the money in you just like set it and forget it and it's not that hard to maintain there are other sources of passive income that require higher degrees of maintenance over time but stocks and shares is a very very easy way to make passive income and to use my personal example these days my stocks and shares portfolio which I've been investing in since 2015 is now worth around about $350,000 and the vast majority of that is in the S&P 500 index fund now I can't be bothered to work out the actual inflation adjusted returns for that but again if we assume a very very rough average of 10% a year then that averages out to around $682 per week in purely passive income all right idea number two for generating passive income is to start a YouTube channel this is something I will specialize in because I'm here on YouTube and I actually teach a course called the part-time YouTuber academy uh links in the video description where I teach people how to do this sort of thing so let's use our side hustle assessment matrix and we'll talk about this how hard is it to start a YouTube channel well I'm gonna give this one out of five stars because it's actually very very easy to start a YouTube channel you just go on youtube.com you click create a channel and you can upload videos but just filming with your phone and uploading it in reality it's a lot harder to make good videos and making good videos is how you grow on YouTube but getting started on YouTube is very very very straightforward the real question is how hard is it to actually make real money from YouTube so again let's say we want to make a hundred dollars a month in passive income what does that look like? well firstly to be eligible for monetization on youtube you need a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time it took me six months and 52 videos to get my first 1000 subscribers and if we look at the averages it actually takes on average 90 something videos to get to a thousand subscribers so that's quite hard if you're thinking you're gonna start a YouTube channel and start making money from day one you're you know that's basically not gonna happen it took me 52 videos six months to get there so if people message me be like hey I want to start a YouTube channel like look you have to be able to put in the effort and do this for a very long period of time at least once a week I say for at least two years before you can expect anything in return but let's say you've hit your thousand subscribers in your 4,000 hours of watch time how hard is it to actually make a hundred dollars a month? well on average the kind of revenue per thousand views on youtube is around about two dollars so this varies massively but let's say on average about two dollars per thousand views therefore if you want to make a hundred dollars a month you need 50,000 views on youtube to make a hundred dollars a month let's say you make one video per week and let's assume you're not getting any traffic on your older videos that means every video you make needs to get around about 12,500 views and very roughly the average youtube channel can expect around about 20 percent of their subscribers to equal the average view count for each video so on youtube if you had 62,000 subscribers very roughly very average you can expect 20 percent of them i.e 12,500 views on each video and assuming you have no evergreen content over the long term you would need to run about 60,000 subscribers to be making a hundred dollars a month in reality you make a hundred dollars a month a lot before 60,000 subscribers i think i was making a hundred dollars a month when i had like 10,000 something subscribers like it was it was fairly early on but when it comes to assessing how hard is this to do i'm going to give this a four out of five stars it's actually very hard to make compelling youtube videos and it's very easy to get started but it's hard to do well it's totally worth it it's a great skill set it's really fun you get to meet people across the internet you get to learn how to talk to a camera and how to film and video edit and it's really great but it's very hard to actually make money from youtube finally in terms of effort to maintain like actually getting that first a thousand subscribers is a lot harder than keeping it growing because once you've got a thousand subscribers and once your channel is growing it means you've landed on a formula that works and so maintaining it then becomes easier than starting from scratch and so in our side hustle assessment matrix we're going to give maintenance of a youtube channel passive income stream to be around about two out of five stars to use my example i made 70 videos before i started making any money from youtube ad sense and these days the youtube channel makes around about twelve thousand dollars a month in passive income from youtube ad sense now again this is not entirely passive because i keep on uploading new videos but actually the bulk of the amount of money that we generate from ads is from older videos rather than videos that are up with that were uploaded this month so with that caveat twelve thousand dollars a month passive income is around about three thousand dollars a week thanks to this youtube channel and thanks to you guys for supporting it and all that stuff there are other ways of monetizing youtube like brand deals and like selling merch and this all other other sort of stuff but it doesn't really count as passive income through youtube which is why i'm not including this in this side hustle assessment matrix idea number three for making passive income is to start a podcast this is generally easier than starting a youtube channel although growing a podcast is a lot harder than growing a youtube channel because because podcasts themselves don't really have a algorithm that's helping them grow in fact a lot of podcasts grow by having a youtube channel which is kind of weird right so how hard is it to start a podcast well again one out of five stars it's very very easy to start a podcast go on anchored.fm and you can literally use your phone and you can pass your phone around between you and your friends and you can start a podcast you can use a website called riverside.fm that i've recently invested in as an angel investor riverside makes it very easy to record remote podcast interviews it's very very easy to start a podcast but how hard is it to make a hundred dollars a month in passive income from a podcast well again this is not quite passive income because the way podcasters make money is by relying on brand deals there is no youtube ad sense for podcasts and so you need a sponsorship or a brand deal to make any money for your podcast generally speaking and apparently you can expect to make around 18 dollars for a 30 second ad in a podcast and 25 dollars per thousand views or a thousand listens are for a 60 second ad so if you want to make a hundred dollars a month and assuming you have a stream of sponsorships who are giving you that level of sponsorship deal based on your download numbers you would need around a thousand downloads per episode if you have a weekly podcast so you would have 4,000 downloads a month and if you're putting a 60 second ad in there for 25 dollars per thousand views that would make you around about a hundred dollars a month by having a thousand downloads per episode and four episodes per month this begs the question how hard is it to get a thousand downloads per month well it's a lot harder to get a thousand podcast downloads per month then it is to get a thousand youtube views per month because again youtube has so much distribution built in it's different to podcasts also loads more people are on youtube than on podcasts but if we look at the stats then it's the top 20 percent of podcasts in the world they get on average more than a thousand downloads per episode to use a friend of mine as an example my housemate sheen started her own podcast around five months ago there will be a link to that in the description if you want to check it out and on average her podcast gets around about four hundred to five hundred downloads per episode this is not bad at all especially considering she started five months ago and had zero audience when she started so she didn't have the unfair advantage that I did when starting my own podcast for example and because she's just launched season two of her podcast and has just started posting videos about it on youtube that will really help the podcast grow and i'm pretty sure that in the next six months she'll be she'll be getting to a point where she can quite easily make a hundred dollars a month from her podcast so going back to a side hustle assessment matrix starting a podcast one out of five stars making a hundred dollars a month i'm gonna give that a three out of five stars because it's hard but not as hard as maybe monetizing on youtube where you have this minimum threshold and finally maintenance well it's not really passive income because you do have to keep on making podcast episodes because the brand deals are associated with that but again once you've stumbled on a formula that works once you know how to be a podcaster it's easier to continue going once you've already gotten started as is the case with most things and so in terms of maintenance of the podcast i'm gonna give that two stars to use me as an example so me and my brother have a podcast called not overthinking link in the video description if you want to check it out but we make run about six hundred and twenty five dollars per week from the podcast overall from brand deals and from our membership all right so idea number four for generating passive income is to become an affiliate marketer affiliate marketing means that you are selling other people's products but you're getting a percentage of the sales from those products now apparently 48% of affiliate marketers globally earn twenty thousand dollars a year which is one thousand six hundred and sixty dollars a month which is actually not bad at all like people are doing very well with affiliate marketing overall so how hard is it to get started with affiliate marketing well i'm gonna give this a two out of five stars basically you can just sign up to an affiliate program like amazon associates so amazon have the run affiliate program which i think is probably the biggest in the world and then once you have your little special links you can post those on your website or on twitter or on social media or whatever and if people buy the product through your link or in fact buy any product on amazon through your link you'll get like some tiny percentage of the sales so pretty easy to get started with affiliate marketing but how hard is it to make a hundred dollars a month oh this is actually kind of hard so let's say you had a product that was fifty dollars that you were trying to sell and you were getting five percent commission on it that would be pretty good amazon doesn't often nearly as much as five percent it offers like two or three percent something like that and let's say your average conversion rate are a people visiting the thing versus people actually buying the product after visiting the thing let's say that's one percent which is pretty reasonable for a conversion rate you would need eight thousand visits to your website or whatever to make a hundred dollars a month it's actually quite hard to get eight thousand visits per month to your website to a specific product page and generally doing well in affiliate marketing requires lots of upfront effort in terms of either building an audience or building such domain authority in whatever space you're in that you're sort of organically getting traffic now other than amazon there are a few other affiliate programs that i'm part of one of them is Skillshare who are kindly sponsoring this video i'll tell you about the sponsor segment later but Skillshare have an interesting affiliate program where if you refer someone to sign up to a free trial of Skillshare you can get seven dollars in affiliate commission just for that thing so if you wanted to make a hundred dollars a month from affiliates you would need fifteen people every month to sign up for Skillshare with your affiliate link thing how hard is it to get fifteen people a month to sign up with your affiliate link well it's not that hard if you have an audience and it's not that hard if you have your own classes on Skillshare like i do i have like nine of them and so if i want to make money through Skillshare affiliates i can just tell people hey guys i like i can tell you that guys i've just released my latest Skillshare class productivity for creators how to start a successful side hustle so there will be a link in the video description if you want to check that out like that would be hopefully some of you will see that we'll click on that link in the description and then that will be me getting some affiliate income from Skillshare for this video so going back to our side hustle assessment matrix how hard is it to make a hundred dollars a month i'm gonna give this a three point five star rating because again you need an audience and as we always talk about on this channel the way you build an audience is by creating useful content putting it for free on the internet once a week and doing this for at least two years if you just follow those three steps i guarantee you'll have an audience and you'll be able to make some kind of money through this passive income stuff but that's quite hard to do no one sticks to it for at least two years so we'll give that a three point five star rating but the good news is once you've created it and once you've started making money from affiliates it's actually quite easy to maintain because especially if you have evergreen content the sort that isn't relying on like current affairs or the latest news the sort that people might search for over a long period of time this becomes like irreversibly reasonable passive income now if we look at me in my business these days from Skillshare we make around about eleven thousand dollars per month in affiliate income which approximates to around two thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars per week and from amazon on average like it's around about four hundred and fifty dollars a month from the amazon uk store and a little bit more from the us in Canada all right method number five of making passive income is by selling digital products now these are products that you create once like an ebook or a download or an app or something like that so you create it once and then you can sell it multiple times because selling digital products doesn't usually have any cost associated with it one really good example is this guy called traff who I follow on twitter who made an iOS 14 icon set and sold it for like thirty dollars a pop a few months ago and ended up making I think like three hundred thousand dollars in the course of like a few weeks just because loads of people around the world wanted to buy his icon pack so he put the work into creating the pack and now he's selling it for lots of money another example is my youtuber friend Oliar who has made as he says seven hundred thousand dollars from selling his website tumblr themes since 2014 so he made the website themes for tumblr he sells them and he makes seven hundred thousand dollars on average uh well overall since since 2014 that's pretty cool so how hard is it to get started making digital products um I mean anyone can write an ebook an ebook counts as a digital product so I'm going to give this a two star rating two out of five stars but obviously like again money is an exchange of value so the thing that you're selling you have to be providing enough value to compensate to make up for the price that you're selling it for and that's often quite hard especially if you don't have an experience in this sort of field and how hard is it to make a hundred dollars a month well you know it's very easy to create an ebook but it's a whole different ballgame trying to get people to actually buy your ebook or buy your icon set or buy your app or buy your website themes and because the market around the stuff is so competitive like you have to be genuinely really good to get people to buy your stuff and the way you get people to pay you money for something is that you identify a problem that they have you solve that problem and then you charge money for it and if you can do those three things then it's you know I wouldn't say it's easy to make a hundred dollars a month but it's very doable to make a hundred dollars a month you just genuinely have to have something that solves the pain point that other people are willing to pay for so we're going to give this a three out of five stars to make a hundred dollars a month from selling digital products and finally in terms of maintenance we're going to give this a two out of five stars because usually you do have to maintain your product a little bit but it's often easier to do like it's much easier to maintain a product than creating a product in the first place idea number six for passive income generation is to create an online course now online course is sort of like a digital product but generally online courses are in video format in fact this whole video is so long it could basically have been an entire online course maybe I'll do one about this very topic and in terms of getting started we're going to give the starting difficulty a two out of five stars because it's not that hard to make an on on online course but generally you do need to know how to do video so you know you actually could film an online course on your iPhone or phone whatever phone you're using if you're one of those Android heathens stick a phone on the side talk to the phone teach something so it's not hard creating one but in terms of making a hundred dollars a month again at that point your course needs to actually be good and the only reason people will pay for it is if the course is actually good now you can avoid having to charge for your online courses by using a website like Skillshare who are very kindly sponsoring this video I have tons of classes in Skillshare I think we've got nine on them in total I've been teaching on Skillshare since September 2019 and I've actually just released my new online class called productivity for creators how to start a successful side hustle where I teach you the internet how you can well create your own side hustle in your spare time without quitting your job if you want to check this out then the first to thousand people to click the link in the video description will get 30% off the annual Skillshare premium membership this is actually a really good deal I pay for Skillshare I have been paying it for it for three years even after I start teaching on it because it's genuinely a fantastic place to learn stuff they've got thousands of classes and all sorts of other topics but you should definitely check out mine like the nine that I've got there are three around productivity now like the fundamentals of productivity the sort of productivity equation which is how I think of productivity and productivity for creators I have two on how you can study for exams if you're in school if you've got exams to prepare for those apparently are really good they've got very high ratings and if you've already had a free trial of Skillshare then you can still use that offer that if you're one of the first a thousand people to hit the link in the video description you will get 30% off the premium membership and you can check out my class which I have to say is pretty good anyway thank you Skillshare for sponsoring this video but genuinely Skillshare is a great place to teach stuff because you can teach things on Skillshare without directly having to charge for them which is why I love putting my courses on Skillshare it's kind of like having something on Netflix in that the end user does not have to pay directly for the product and the other nice thing about Skillshare is that it's like the it's sort of like YouTube in that anyone can upload a class to Skillshare provided it needs certain quality requirements and so it's a lot easier than having to make your own website and create your own courses platform and all that kind of stuff so pretty easy to start we're gonna give this a two out of five but how hard is it to make a hundred dollars a month from teaching online courses now this kind of depends if you're going down the Skillshare route then to make a hundred dollars a month on Skillshare you need around about 1700 minutes of watch time which is 28 hours of watch time so if you have a one hour class on Skillshare you need 28 students to take that class every month and watch it with a premium membership roughly very broadly speaking and that will give you around about a hundred dollars a month at least those are based on my figures over the last like two years of being on Skillshare now how hard is it to get 28 people a month watching your class well if your class is actually pretty good it shouldn't be too hard to get 28 people a month watching it if you have an existing audience it's very easy to get 28 people a month watching it because people already know like and trust you hopefully and so they'll watch your stuff and give you a shot because you've already built that good will with them but the nice again the nice thing about Skillshare as a platform is that they have like their own algorithm so the good stuff rises to the top so if you genuinely have a really really really good class and you put it on Skillshare then even if you don't have an audience there is still a high chance that if the class is actually good and people watch it a lot and people recommend it and give it high ratings it will rise to the top and it will start getting recommended to people who find it on the Skillshare homepage or who search for it specifically the other way of making a hundred dollars a month from a course is to just charge a hundred dollars for a course and then if you do that you just need one sale every month so how hard is it to get one person a month to buy your course well again if it's good you know the world of online education is exploding so much every year more and more money is being spent on online education especially with the whole pandemic stuff so if you have a valuable skill that you can teach I think courses are one of the best and easier easiest oh well one of the best ways of making passive income because it's fun to create a course you can teach stuff you don't need that many technical skills like making a website or anything like that just shove it on Skillshare and then people can take your course and learn on the internet and like you know it's just cool overall and the nice thing is that once you've made the course and once you're making a hundred dollars a month from it maintaining that level is actually quite easy we're gonna give that a two out of five stars because generally you don't need to update the course that often and you can do that once in a while and you just need to make sure you're getting a reasonable amount of traffic to it and hopefully that traffic will grow over time these days the vast majority of my online courses at least the very passive ones are hosted on Skillshare and it's kind of ridiculous but these days they make around about 60,000 to 65,000 dollars per month in purely passive income like I literally do nothing for my Skillshare glasses once I've made them other than reply to comments and other than occasionally plug them in videos and that's like 60,000 dollars a month in passive income that means this is around about 15,000 dollars per week and this makes up the bulk of the 27,000 dollars a week that this business currently generates in purely passive income. Idea number seven for passive income is by creating some kind of paid membership or community model. Now again this is generally a bad idea unless you have an existing audience which we keep coming back to like everything becomes easier when you have an existing audience by creating content that has been valuable over a long period of time very consistently that audience knows likes and trusts you and so when you say hey guys sign up to my Patreon then some people are likely to do that thing. The other way of doing a membership is by creating a value proposition that is so compelling that people will be willing to pay for a community like service for this. If we use Patreon as an example my friend Hannah Witten who's a youtuber she's got around about 600,000 subscribers on YouTube and I think she has around 600 patrons 626 last time I checked which means if we look at her Patreon stats which a public she's making somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 pounds or like 3,000 and 7,000 dollars per month in passive income from this audience but it's like 600 people out of an audience of 600,000 so one in a thousand of her subscribers have signed up to her Patreon so clearly you know if those stats are true across the board and they kind of are if you look at mad developers Patreon as well you need a big audience to make a significant amount of money for Patreon. Again this sort of depends on how much you're charging for them and exactly what value you're providing. Another example of a paid membership is my friend Anne Law who runs a website called Nest Labs and they have a paid membership community which is $5 a month and she started this when when was it in summer of 2019 she had zero audience at the time and she just wrote a hundred blog posts over a hundred working days and built up an audience such that in March 2020 when she launched a membership she had some paying members for initially and I think last month she's just passed a hundred thousand dollars a year in annual recurring revenue which is pretty awesome from something that started less than two years ago. So how easy is it to start a membership program? Well it's actually very easy we can give this a one star because it's very easy to start one you just make an account on some kind of membership platform like Patreon but to make a hundred dollars a month you need to provide a hundred dollars a month worth of value and that's actually quite hard to do we're going to give that a four out of five stars but the nice thing is again once you've got that formula once you're making a hundred dollars a month it's actually a lot easier to maintain it because the way the economics of membership community's work is provided you keep showing up and providing value in some capacity you know people have already signed up for the thing so it's not too hard to maintain that level of support that you're offering them. For this business we have a membership community for our part-time YouTuber academy for the alumni which is called the part-time YouTuber Inno Circle and we make roughly two thousand eight hundred dollars a week from this membership community it's not very passive we run like three or four events per week along with like twice a day co-working events on zoom and we have lots of stuff going on so it takes a lot of work but two thousand thousand eight hundred dollars a week is pretty good for a membership community. All right, nearly there so idea number eight for generating passive income is creating a business that sells goods or services and then automating or delegating aspects of that business so that the income that you generate from it is reasonably passive. This is a stuff that Tim Ferris talks a lot about in the four hour work week where there are a lot of businesses that you could make where you're selling a good or selling a service and then you can delegate outsource automate in intelligent ways to make the income passive. So again using my friend Oliore as an example on his YouTube channel he talks about his one million dollar Shopify store he designs manufacturers and sells these really cool vegan leather kind of desk accessories and bags and mouse pads and that kind of stuff and this was loads of work in setting up but now he's got a team of three other people that manage the business and so he spends proportionately less of his time running that business and so it's sort of passive income for him even though these days he still does spend around 10 hours a week maintaining things. Equally if you're going down the service route I've got a friend who runs an Instagram and Facebook ads marketing agency where he has clients who pay him some I think a few hundred dollars per month to manage their Facebook and Instagram ads and for him it's like a small amount of work initially to set up the Facebook and Instagram ads but then it's sort of automated and he's got a team around it and he's using things like Zapier to automate aspects of that business so that each month he has to do a very small amount of actual work to keep it ticking along. So these are different ways of generating passive income from a kind of good or service based business but it's quite hard to get started with this stuff. To get started we're going to give this a four out of five star rating because again you need to create a business and it's quite hard to make a business that genuinely provides value. Equally we're going to give it a four out of five star rating for making a hundred dollars a month in revenue because again you have to be able to provide value and providing value is hard like it's not as easy as making an account on a stock's platform just putting some money in you actually have to give value to people which is kind of hard but the nice thing is once you get started like with anything maintenance is a little bit easier so we're going to give that a three out of five star rating. Finally idea number nine for generating passive income is to build an app or a website or some kind of software product that you can offer either as one off or more likely these days as a subscription service and there's a whole category of this called SaaS software as a service. Now if you look at the website indihacris.com there are like literally hundreds of examples of people who have built software businesses that are making passive income and they share the revenue numbers and they tell you how they got started and they give you their tips. In fact I was recently interviewed on an episode of the Indihacris podcast which is really cool because I've been listening to it for years and like following the website for years and I was interviewed around the concept of starting an online course like the part time youtuber academy. Now I've had a bit of personal experience with this so when I was at university I made a website called B-Matt Ninja and UK Cat Ninja so software as a service it was a question bank for medical applicants applying to medical school to help them do well in the admissions tests and this was something that me and my brother coded completely from scratch. He and I both know how to code we learned when we were young and so we worked over the summer of 2015 to make these things happen. I think in year one we made about $10,000 and in year five last year it was around $25,000 from B-Matt Ninja so you know it's pretty good money but it was a lot of work to set these things up and so in terms of starting out I'm going to give you say five out of five start racing because to make an app it's actually quite hard you have to know how to code for the most part you have to be able to offer something compelling and you have to actually build it which takes a lot of work and it's very hard but it's a lot of fun and then once you've made it I'm going to give a hundred dollar a month difficulty a four-star rating because again it's easy well easy enough you can make an app but then getting people to pay for the app is an entirely different kind of fish so we're going to give that four stars but the nice thing is like with everything maintenance is a little bit easier so we're going to give that a three-star rating. If you like this video and you want to get started with your own entrepreneurship e-passive incoming generating journey on the internet I check out this short playlist over here which is some of my favorite videos that I've made around tips for entrepreneurs how I got started creating my businesses from scratch how I learned to code that sort of stuff that's all in the playlist over here thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye bye",
	" Alright, let's talk about crypto. Now, you've probably heard the word Bitcoin floating around, you might have seen that price has been skyrocketing recently, you might have seen that Tesla has bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and is going to start accepting it as payment, and you might have heard of all these weird things called dogecoin which are apparently going to the moon. As such, this video is my personal guide to the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, it's the introduction that I wish I would have had when I started investing in crypto about four years ago, and it's the video that I want to be able to send to my friends whenever they ask me, hey, are you investing in Bitcoin? Why are you investing in Bitcoin? How does it work? Is it safe? Are you going to lose your money? Isn't it illegal? All of this sort of stuff. So, this video, which is for informational purposes only, and should absolutely not be construed as financial advice in the slightest, we're going to split it up into four parts. Firstly, I'll talk about what Bitcoin is and how cryptocurrencies in general work and why they work and why they legit. Secondly, we'll talk about why Bitcoin and crypto is so controversial and I'll share my hot tags about that. Thirdly, we'll talk about why I personally do invest in Bitcoin and crypto, and I will share my portfolio allocation and the reasons behind that, and fourthly, we'll talk about how you can get started investing in crypto if that's a sort of thing you want to do with lots and lots of caveats and cautionary tales along the way. As always, timestamps in the video description so you can jump around if you feel like it, and if you need to the channel, hello, nice to meet you. My name is Ali. I'm a doctor based in Cambridge in the UK, and on this channel, we normally explore the tools and strategies that help us live healthier, happier, more productive lives, but I have a personal penchant for the topic of money, and I think more people should learn about money and investing and finance at how it works, and be open about that sort of stuff. So here we are talking about this video. Anyway, let's get into section number one. All right, so let's take things back to basics to try and build up our understanding of Bitcoin from the ground up. Now, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. There are hundreds of other cryptocurrencies out there, but Bitcoin is like the original, the OG, and it's by far the biggest cryptocurrency around, which begs the question, what is a cryptocurrency? So here's my definition of a cryptocurrency based on four central concepts. A cryptocurrency is a virtual currency based on a ledger, which is decentralized and secured by cryptography. All right, so firstly, Bitcoin is a virtual currency. Now, what is a currency? Well, a currency is just a medium of exchange. It's what replaces the old school bartering system we used to have when it would be like, I will give you this bushel of wheat in return for the shoe that you have kindly made me because you are a, I don't know, leather worker. Obviously, that system of bartering is quite inefficient because you have to store lots of stuff that other people want, and that's just a bit of a pain. And so we invented currency in the form of coins, usually as a system that everyone recognized to be able to exchange stuff without having the physical goods. So I could sell my bushel of wheat for two copper coins, and then I could save up my copper coins, and I could buy your shoes for 10 copper coins, for example. Back in the day, currency itself was tied to metals like gold and silver and copper, which had like different values. And so the actual metal of the coins was worth something because everyone agreed that these metals were somewhat precious. But in modern times, most of our currency takes the form of paper notes, and paper notes aren't inherently worth anything because the paper is just worth paper. But currency is worth something because everyone agrees that it's worth something. If I take a hundred dollars almost anywhere in the world, most people in most places in the world will recognize that a hundred dollars is worth a hundred dollars, and I'd be able to buy a hundred dollars worth of stuff from it. If hypothetically, the whole world or to tomorrow decide that the US dollar is a meaningless currency, and they're not going to accept it for anything at all, then the US dollar would be worthless. So really, when it comes to currency, it doesn't mean anything real. Currency is kind of just an abstract way that we've all agreed to value things in a certain way. So coming back to Bitcoin, Bitcoin is virtual currency. It is a digital form of currency, i.e. a digital form of paying for goods and services and exchanging money over the internet. Way back in 2009, when Bitcoin was first invented, most people didn't believe that it would be a viable form of currency. But over the last decade plus, as Bitcoin has become more and more popular, people are starting to say that maybe Bitcoin could be the currency of the future. Maybe in the future, maybe a few years, a few decades from now, we'll be paying for goods and services using Bitcoin over the internet rather than by using these old school, old-fashioned centralized banking and government institutions to exchange US dollars and our actual local currencies. Okay, so that was the currency part of it. We can think of Bitcoin or crypto as like internet money or like virtual money or virtual currency. Let's now talk about the ledger system that holds it all together. And the thing to understand here is that Bitcoin is effectively one giant huge spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is called a ledger. And in the spreadsheet, we've got a record of every single Bitcoin transaction that has ever happened since January 2009 when Bitcoin was first invented. And the way that I think of it in my head is like, let's say you're going on holiday with a group of friends and you don't want to kind of keep on splitting the bill and handing over cash because that's a total nightmare. Therefore, someone makes a spreadsheet to keep track of who owes what. And so line one in the spreadsheet might be Ali O's Sheen 12 pounds, line two might be Jake O's Molly 18 pounds. And the idea is that as our holiday goes on, we would keep on adding stuff to our spreadsheet or our ledger. And at the end of the holiday, we would all settle up and then actual money would exchange hands. Now assuming you trust your friends to be honest, this spreadsheet actually works reasonably well. You can basically treat this whole spreadsheet as virtual money. I am giving my friend virtual 10 pounds in exchange for them paying for dinner. Other friend is giving me virtual 20 pounds in exchange for me paying for the boat ride. Now that's fine for a group of a few people on holiday, but imagine hypothetically if the whole world were to run on a similar spreadsheet where instead of money ever exchanging hands like physically, it would just be a line item in the spreadsheet. Now imagine a world in which everyone trusted the spreadsheet and everyone was being honest and good and nice and friendly and only adding legitimate things to the spreadsheet that everyone agreed on. That's basically what Bitcoin is. It's this giant spreadsheet that keeps track of absolutely every single transaction that's ever happened regarding Bitcoin since the start of Bitcoin. And so that means that this spreadsheet has a record of everyone in the world who has ever bought and sold Bitcoin. And it tells you how much Bitcoin they've bought and sold. So you can work out how much Bitcoin each person has in their account. Now let's say I have two bitcoins in my account, which is quite a lot of money these days. And I would give one Bitcoin to a friend. We could add to this spreadsheet. Ali gives one Bitcoin to Jake and because it's all in one spreadsheet, the spreadsheet knows that my Bitcoin account has now one Bitcoin and Jake's Bitcoin account now has one Bitcoin in it as well. Now fundamentally this is all Bitcoin really is. It's just a giant as spreadsheet, but it's got some other fancy features that make it really, really clever and that make it a potential candidate for the currency of the future. See the problem with our ledger system is that if it's on a spreadsheet, usually it's one person who's maintaining the spreadsheet. So let's say I'm in holiday with friends and everyone trusts me to do this to be the spreadsheet guy because I'm a massive nerd. And therefore anytime they want to post a transaction, they would say, hey, Ali, Catherine has given Lucia 10 pounds and therefore I will add it to the spreadsheet. This is fine because my friends trust me and I'm a massive nerd. But we don't want a entire system of financial stuff based on this centralized model because that's kind of what we have already. Like every bank financial institution government in the world is some sort of centralized authority that handles money. And so the US dollar is tied to the Federal Reserve and the US government. The UK pound is tied to the Bank of England and then it's all someone related to like the International Monetary Fund and then like the government has something to do with it. But essentially it's a small group of actors like governments and banks that manage the financial system for basically every country in the world. And so the third part of our definition of a cryptocurrency is that it needs to be decentralized. And the way that Bitcoin and all these other cryptocurrencies work is that there is no central person in charge of them. There is no one person or one company saying hey I have got the master spreadsheet. Instead what happens is that every single person in the world can have a copy of that master spreadsheet if they want. And so with Bitcoin for example there are millions of people around the world on their computers who each have a copy of the master spreadsheet and each of those computers are running software that's constantly checking to make sure that master spreadsheet is legit. And it's the same as every other copy of the master spreadsheet on the network. And that means that if you want to hack Bitcoin it's quite hard to do because there's like millions of people around all around the world who are helping to maintain it. And it means that if you want to unduly influence stuff like if you're a bank or a government or some other evil person it's quite hard to do because again it's decentralized it means that it's being maintained and managed by millions of people all around all around the world from their computers. And now we get to the final part of our definition which is that this whole system is built and secured using cryptography. So cryptography is a branch of maths and computer science that's associated with like code making and code breaking. And cryptography is how all of our communications are encrypted. So for example when you send a WhatsApp message there is no way that WhatsApp or Facebook can read the message because it's encrypted by cryptography on either end. And so only the center in the recipient can see what the message is. No one in the middle can see what the message is. It's becoming encrypted. It's just like a bunch of numbers that no one can interpret. And the really clever thing about Bitcoin and these are the cryptocurrencies is that they use cryptography to solve the problem of trust and to solve the problem of centralization. The problem of trust is that when I'm on holiday with my friends we all trust each other and we know that no one's going to screw anyone over but in real life that doesn't necessarily happen. So your system needs to be secure enough so as not to rely on trusting individuals. And secondly the problem of centralization i.e. it can't just be Google owning a Google sheet that everyone gets a copy of because Google controls it. It can't just be Amazon. It can't be the US government. It can't be the Bank of England. It needs to be truly decentralized in a way that everyone maintains and manages the system. All right now it's time for a little basic introduction to the world of cryptography. This is a little bit complicated. If you don't want to hear it you can skip to this timestamp down below and that will take you to the next section. But essentially cryptography is really really cool and I am just now kind of dabbling in the world of cryptography and trying to understand it. So here are a few concepts and how I've kind of explained it to myself in my head. Essentially cryptography is based around the use of one-way functions called hash functions. And the idea behind there is that you can put any message or anything through a hash function and it will spit out a totally random combination of letters and numbers on the other end in such a way that you can't then reverse the function. And so if we were to take my name and put it through a hash function called SHA256 which is the one that bitcoin uses but explaining it is a bit too hard. We'll come out with this random string of letters and numbers. And now if you were to just look at that random string of letters and numbers there is no way you can reverse the chain to go back to what the original message was. Now bitcoin uses these hash functions to solve both those problems. It solves the problem of trust by using digital signatures based around secret keys and public keys in this thing called public key cryptography. And essentially it means that you as an individual can have a secret key a password that no one else knows. But then you have a public key which is sort of related to your password which other people do know but that's fine because they can never find out your true password. And as long as you use your true password to sign your messages it's 100% basically 100% guarantee that those messages are legit. So that kind of solves the trust problem and we solve the decentralization problem by using this concept called proof of work where all of the different people on the network on the bitcoin network who are maintaining the system are called bitcoin miners and what these guys try and do is they essentially try and solve a hash puzzle which just requires lots and lots and lots of computing power effectively involves guessing multiple numbers multiple times. And this is a sort of lottery between everyone on the network so that if you are the lucky person who's plucked the random number out of thin air that solves the hash puzzle then your spreadsheet kind of gets saved and then that save state is permanent and then you get rewarded with some bitcoin for giving up your computing power to help kind of maintain the whole thing. And I'm using a lot of jargon and this is actually very hard to break down in like an easy way. There are two sources I'd recommend and I would recommend these if you are actually interested in learning how cryptography works. Firstly is a video from one of my favorite YouTube channels 3 blue one brown called but how does bitcoin work where he explains the basics of hash functions and cryptography and like chart 256 and this sort of stuff. And secondly is actually an online course from brilliant who are very kindly sponsoring this video. Now bear with me here. So brilliant is an online platform for courses in math science and computer science and the most recent course is all about cryptocurrencies and cryptography and it's got like tons of different bits in it that really help you understand crypto from the ground up and I've been working through this course on brilliant for the last few weeks and it's really helped improve my own understanding of crypto and in fact when preparing for this video I was just like redoing that course because it's just so good and it like really nails it down from first principles to explain how bitcoin works and the way they do it is they sort of create bitcoin from the ground up and kind of explain all of the maths behind it in a way that's interactive and engaging and fun. So if this stuff seems interesting to you if you want to understand how public key cryptography works secret keys private decentralized action hash functions, merkle nodes, this sort of cool stuff you should definitely check out that course over at brilliant. If you're one of the first 200 people to hit the link in the video description or head over to brilliant.org forward slash Ali then you will get 20% of the annual premium subscription and along with that you get access to all the other courses on math science and computer science as well. I particularly like the course on Python fundamentals and advanced Python. Python is the world's most popular programming language. So that's what I'm going to say about the cryptography part of like what are cryptocurrencies. Definitely check out the course on brilliant if you want to learn more about it. Let's now move on to topic number two. Why is bitcoin and crypto so controversial. So there's broadly four reasons as to why bitcoin is controversial. Number one, the speculation bubble, number two, the environmental impact, number three security issues and number four, the threat of illegal activity. Firstly, a lot of people say that bitcoin is a speculative bubble. The price of bitcoin is not based. People say on any intrinsic value behind bitcoin, it is in fact based on people like you and me thinking, oh my god, bitcoin's a big deal. Therefore we buy it and therefore supply and demand means that the price goes up. People have been saying this since like 2011 when the price of bitcoin was absolutely nothing compared to the like the $50,000 that it is now. And yes, there is an extent to which bitcoin is a speculative bubble. And in fact, when I invest in bitcoin, I don't really think of it as investing. I do in fact think of it as gambling, which I'm going to talk a little bit more about later. And people would say that for example, when Elon Musk tweets that he's about to buy bitcoin suddenly the price source really, really, really high, that is not the sign of how a market would respond to an underlying value increase. It is in fact how the market would respond to speculation. Elon Musk is buying bitcoin. Therefore, every one of the world is like, oh my god, Elon Musk is buying bitcoin. Therefore, they buy bitcoin. Therefore, the price goes up. It's not like bitcoin has fundamentally changed because of Elon Musk's tweet. It's just that people are speculating at it, which is why it's this sort of speculative bubble. Secondly, bitcoin is controversial because of the energy consumption and alleged environmental impact of the technology. So because it is decentralized and run by resilience of computers, resilience of nodes all around the world, people would say that those nodes use lots and lots of energy, use lots of computing power. Therefore, lots of electricity in order to solve the hash puzzles that the whole bitcoin system is based around. Now, the anti-bitcoin people would say that this use of energy is not very good because it's bad for the environment and it's causing carbon to go into the atmosphere, etc, etc, just to maintain a system. Whereas the pro bitcoin people would say, yeah, that's true. But like we need to use energy to maintain any system and the actual banking industry uses far more energy than bitcoin does or will in the near future. And they would say that these kind of bitcoin mining farms are in countries like Iceland and Greenland where it's very cold and where there's very lot of cold air and therefore the cooling of it becomes more efficient. And they would say that China does a lot of bitcoin mining and energy is cheap in China. And then the anti-bitcoin people would say, yeah, but China still produces a load of environmentally bad stuff because of their excessive use of energy and maintaining the bitcoin network. Ultimately, I don't know what the answer is. There are pros and cons. Everything kind of uses energy. People say bitcoin is bad because it uses more energy than it should. I don't know. I'm just don't shoot the messenger. That is just one of the reasons as to why people think bitcoin is is a bit controversial. Thirdly, bitcoin is controversial because people are sometimes worried about security issues. And theoretically, the whole system is sort of decentralized and trustless and like maintained by these millions of nodes all around the world. In practice, there are these things called crypto exchanges. Now these are big companies, sort of like the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. There are an exchange that connects buyers to sellers. And because a lot of people who have accounts on these exchanges also use the exchange to store their bitcoin, like the exchange also stores bitcoin for you. Like I have all my bitcoin and coin base. If Coinbase were to get hacked for whatever reason, then I might lose my bitcoin. Add in the past kind of decade, there have been quite a few high profile hacking instances where the exchange has been targeted and users have lost their crypto. In practice, this is not something that I am personally particularly worried about. If you're worried about it, you can do lots and lots of other things to secure your bitcoin, like use a hardware wallet. There's loads of YouTube videos explaining that kind of outside the scope of this one. But security issues is reason number three, why bitcoin is controversial. And reason number four is the fact that bitcoin is sometimes used as a form of payment for illegal activities. Like let's say you want to buy drugs or you want to buy bad things on the dark web or whatever that means. You can pay in bitcoin and you can receive bitcoin and theoretically your bitcoin username is like a random string of letters and numbers that is not directly tied to you as an individual. And therefore bitcoin is a way that unscrupulous people across the internet can facilitate payments without needing to verify their identity with anyone. In fairness, people can also do illegal things with US dollars and every other form of currency in the world. But people would say like the anti bitcoin people would say bitcoin is bad because it's fundamentally anonymous and therefore you never know who the actual person is on the other end unless you kind of trust them initially. And therefore because this even more facilitates the use of illegal activities, this is therefore bad. I don't buy that argument personally. I mean the internet itself can be a good or bad thing depending on the context in which it's used. I personally think bitcoin could be the future and it is broadly a good thing. But of course it could be a bad thing depending on how it's used. And so that brings us on to section three. Having said all of that about the potential issues with bitcoin, why do I personally invest in it? And again, let's break this down into four parts. Number one is FOMO, number two, gambling, number three, fun, number four diversification. So firstly, I've got to be honest, the primary reason I invest in crypto is because I have a fear of missing out. Like I first heard about bitcoin in 2011, like everyone else did, and then I'm thinking damn, if only I'd bought bitcoin in 2011, I'd be a multi-millionaire by now and I'd never have to work a day in my life. And then for me like every few years I'd hear about bitcoin and be like, oh it's you know, bitcoin's now a hundred dollars. You know, if only I'd invested two years ago, but I can't possibly get it now because it's a hundred dollars and that's way too expensive. If I'd gotten another hundred dollars, bitcoin is now worth fifty thousand dollars. Therefore, I automated a lot of money. But like, you know, it's this sense of fear of missing out, which is why I personally do invest in crypto. Secondly, crypto feels like a socially acceptable form of gambling. I don't really consider it an investment. In a way, I consider it gambling. I'm not a fan of gambling normally, but it's like, it's kind of fun to gamble on bitcoin. And in fact, in 2017, the last time bitcoin had like a real heyday, I'd put in about 60,000 pounds of my money into bitcoin and I was plus 40k at one point. Like, my portfolio was worth a hundred grand and I'd only put in 60 grand. So I'd made 40,000 in the space of a few weeks. And that was like a very addictive feeling because it was like, within the space of a few weeks, I've made more money than I would have made in a whole year as working as a doctor. Then I subsequently lost lots of money in the December 2017 crash and I ended up with like negative 35,000 or something like that. And so that's a bit of a cautionary tale, but ultimately I do consider it a form of gambling that I'm happy to engage in with some amount of my money. So at least it's just kind of fun. It's fun to be a part of the future. It's fun to keep up to the news like with the news about bitcoin. It's fun to look at the portfolio occasionally and be like, oh, are we up? Are we down? How are things going? And it's fun to feel as if yeah, to feel like part of this like revolution. And I genuinely do think that bitcoin could be the future of money and I want to be like a part of that and that just feels kind of fun. And fourthly, if I do think of it as an investment, it's like, I've got some percentage of my portfolio in crypto and that theoretically helps me diversify more my portfolio, which is otherwise mostly in stocks and shares. And the way I think of it is that like this is not generally true, but like assuming crypto is not correlated with the broader US stock market, it means that if I invest in crypto, if I gamble my money on crypto currencies, it means that I hedge kind of the risk of stock market going down and losing money in that kind of way. Not really legit because I do consider it gambling and just like a bit of fun, but I'm throwing that in there to make this a list of four. So what is my strategy for investing, slag gambling in crypto? Well, these days I have about 20% of my overall like investment portfolio in crypto in a combination of bitcoin and Ethereum, mostly Ethereum because I actually bought loads of Ethereum like four years ago and just held onto it. So I think my allocation is about 80% Ethereum, 20% bitcoin. 20% of my overall portfolio in crypto is quite a high number. Someone like Graeme Stefan who is far more pro at personal finance than I am and also has far more money than I do has like one to two percent of his portfolio in crypto as he talks about on his YouTube channel. I have 20% of mine in crypto and that's quite a high allocation. Like the main thing with crypto is that you only want to put in money that you can 100% afford to lose because it's quite a high risk speculative investment. I don't think of it as an investment. I think of it as gambling. So it's like I'm gambling with 20% of my overall investment portfolio. That for me is a number that I'm happy with. Like I am happy with like if tomorrow I lost that 20% I wouldn't care in the slightest. I like to think it wouldn't affect my mental wellbeing at all. And I know this because when I lost 35,000 pounds in 2017 which at the time was like half my net worth. It didn't affect me at all. So I've kind of been through that losing large amounts of money and realizing okay this is not too bad. Therefore I've sort of put my arbitrary risk profile that I'm happy with to be 20% of my portfolios in crypto. The other 80% of my portfolio is in stocks and shares and that's sort of fairly fairly standard. But 20% crypto 80% stocks in stocks and shares. This is probably a bit too high. If I were talking to a friend again not financial advice and you're not my friend so I'm not giving you financial advice purely for entertainment and informational purposes only. But if I were talking to a friend and they were like hey I want to put some money in crypto. I probably say that 20% is probably a bit high. Like you probably don't want to run the risk of losing 20% of your money overnight if Bitcoin goes to zero. You might want it to start with maybe 2% or 3% or 5% you know something that you're a little bit more comfortable with than 20%. So if you do want to get started firstly you want to understand the underlying technology so do that course over at Brilliant you know who are sponsoring this video that cryptography course that helps you understand the underlying technology and helps you understand why this works and why I personally think it's legit. Secondly there are two things you need. You need a wallet to store your cryptocurrency and you need an exchange where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Now most big exchanges will also let you store currency on the platform. So I use coinbase for everything. Please don't try and hack my coinbase account. But I use coinbase for everything and so I have my Bitcoin and Ethereum stored in coinbase itself and I also use coinbase as the exchange to buy and sell. Coinbase is one of the biggest ones in the world. There are a few others. You can always google like best crypto exchange USA or best crypto exchange Pakistan or best crypto exchange UK. I personally use coinbase it's available in the UK. It's very nice and easy. No affiliation with them. No affiliate links or anything like that but coinbase if you're watching this. Richard if you want to sponsor a video below. In practice you do want to secure your account so obviously on my coinbase account I have two factor authentication enabled and if you really care about security you can invest in something like a physical wallet which is like a hardware wallet that stores your Bitcoin offline. Again be on the scope of this video to explain how that works but that is like a much more secure way of storing your Bitcoin rather than having it stored on the internet in an exchange like coinbase. So that was my beginners introduction to crypto. This has been a far longer video than I thought it would be. If you're serious about investing I recommend you don't start with crypto. I recommend instead you start with stocks and shares and that video over there is my half an hour long introduction to how to invest in stocks and shares for beginners. I still have 80% plus of my portfolio in stocks and shares and only 20% of it in crypto. That's a really high number for most friends. If I was talking to a not giving financial advice I would recommend 95% stocks and shares and like 5% crypto. So definitely check that video out. Thanks for watching. Hope you found it useful and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye.",
	" Hey friends welcome back to the book club series where we distill and discuss highlights from some of my favorite books and today we're talking about your money or your life by Vicky Robbins which is one of the most important books that completely changed my relationship with money. Its subtitle is Nine Steps to Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independence which sounds a bit like self-helpy but actually it's it's a very well put together book that when I read it re-changed my mindset when it came to work and money and how it kind of fits into my life. Let's start with a passage from the book that really resonated once upon a time earning a living was the means to an end. The means was earning and the end was living but over time our relationship with money earning it spending it investing it owning it protecting it worrying about it has taken over the major part of our lives. Most of us spend more than 40 hours of the week's total of 168 hours earning money. We must take time to dress for our jobs commute to our jobs think about our jobs at work and when we're at home decompress from our jobs we must spend money to maintain our jobs job costuming commuting costs food bought expensively at the workplace with all that time and money spent on and around our jobs is it any wonder that we've come to take our identities from them when asked what do you do we don't say I do plumbing we say I am a plumber she goes on to make the point that we're not really making a living from work do we come home from our making a living activity with more life do we bound through the door refreshed and energized ready for a great evening with family and where's all the life that we supposedly made at work and she says that for many of us we're not making a living instead we are making a dying we are essentially wiling away our life energy on this thing that we call our job in the hope that it's going to bring us meaning and fulfilment and joy and happiness and money and we say that the things that we value are our friends our family our local community and certainly in in every study that's been done on happiness those are the things that lead to a happy meaningful and fulfilled life and yet most of the hours that we spend of our life energy is devoted to our jobs this is making a dying rather than making a living so that was point number one the next major theme in the book is about the question what is enough in an environment of more is better enough is like the horizon always receding and there's a concept that she talks about that really illustrates this and it's called the fulfillment curve it shows the relationship between the experience of fulfillment and the amount of money that we spend at the beginning of our lives more possessions means more fulfillment as we get our basic needs met and as we move from the bare necessities to the niceties the positive relationship between new things and fulfillment becomes more deeply embedded we then move beyond niceties to luxuries and throughout these stages we increasingly come to associate more money with increased levels of fulfillment because that's the way the curve's going but then one day we hit a fulfillment ceiling where more money and more possessions don't actually give us lasting fulfillment and beyond that peak of enough we then started to accumulate more and more clutter the more and more stuff we buy and then the fulfillment curve starts to go downwards the more we spend the more we accumulate but the less satisfaction we're able to accrue from these possessions and so with this in mind what I think about all the time is like where is my concept of enough like in all the different aspects of life and in fact this research from Nobel Prize winning economist Daniel Kahneman about this relationship between money and happiness and he finds that at a certain point more money does not lead to more happiness and that point of enough in some of the studies is around 75,000 dollars a year and so ultimately as Robin says fulfillment is our compass and our rudder for transforming our relationship with money a thirdly she talks a lot about how instead of thinking of money as this nebulous concept we can think of money as our life energy like the concept of money is quite hard to define but what's always going to be true is that money is what we exchange our life energy for our life energy is essentially our allotment of time here on earth the precious hours of life available to us so every expense that we have everything that we buy is actually equivalent to hours of life energy that we've given up to earn the money to buy the thing and once we start thinking of money as this proxy for life energy we can start to calculate the real cost of stuff in terms of life energy for example if we're eyeing up that new iPad Air that costs 800 dollars and we're working in a job that pays us 10 dollars an hour that would be 80 hours of life energy we're exchanging for this iPad or two weeks of full-time work and then we can ask ourselves is that really worth it on that note one thing that really is worth the life energy that we exchange for it is investing on ourselves investing and learning investing in our skills and a fantastic way of doing that is by taking online courses over a brilliant or very kindly sponsoring this video if you haven't heard Brieglint is an amazing platform for interactive courses on maths science and computer science the courses are all engaging and interactive and fun in a way that really sort of teaches you the bare bones of the concept and then lets you apply it to real life scenarios so it's much more interesting than the way that we learn school stuff one of their newer courses that I've quite liked is about knowledge and uncertainty and that looks at things like Bayesian networks causal inference and information theory but all in a package that's engaging and accessible if you want to join me in taking the class and investing in yourself then head over to brilliant.org forward slash Ali and the first 200 people to hit that link will get 20% of the annual premium subscription obviously any amount of money that we spend is an exchange of our life energy but as I said when we're investing in ourselves that life energy is generally worth it and it's certainly is the case for brilliant and in fact one way to justify purchases of anything including brilliant is by asking ourselves three questions when it comes to the stuff that we're buying firstly did I receive fulfillment and satisfaction and value in proportion to the life energy spent and this question is good because it forces us to think about how much life energy we're actually spending to acquire the things that we think that we want. Secondly is this expenditure of life energy in alignment with my values and life purpose and this encourages us to think about like is the thing that we're buying actually in line with what we say we want from life and what we morally believe and thirdly how might this expenditure change if I didn't have to work for money and this question is interesting because it forces us to think about like whether we're buying this thing because it relates to our job for example if we're buying a fancy suit to where to work to impress our colleagues or a fancy watch that you know our colleagues can give a nod to if we didn't have to go to work would we still have that expense and I think it really highlights an aspect of life that we don't often think about which is that in order to maintain our jobs and maintain our standard of living supposedly for our peers we end up spending a lot more money than we really have to and so those were just three discussion points from the book there is so much more to talk about there's some really interesting stuff in here about jobs and the history of work and how we think about money and leisure and fulfillment and meaning and all that kind of stuff but if you want to learn about how I've personally applied the principles in here to achieve financial independence and hit the playlist over here which talks about how I developed various streams of passive income to get to this point of financial independence thank you very much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you in the next one",
	" So last year I uploaded a video about nine passive income ideas that were making me $27,000 a week at the time and that video absolutely blew up and since then I've been inundated with messages from like YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, all the places of people asking for more ideas for side hustles that they can start this year. So in this video we're going to go over seven side hustle ideas that you can start to make money on the internet if you want and for each of these we're going to talk about how easy it is to start, how easy it is to make your first $100 and then how hard or time intensive is it to keep going. So let's get into it. Right so idea number one is actually to become a video editor for YouTubers. Now bear with me over here. This is actually not as crazy as it sounds. It's pretty straightforward to learn how to edit videos. I even have a class on this on Skillshare link in the video description if you want to check it out. And so within a weekend you can literally teach yourself how to edit videos using final cut or Premiere or iMovie or DaVinci Resolve or any other app. You can teach yourself how to edit videos completely from scratch having never done it before. And then if you want to make money using the service we just need to find people who are willing to pay for that service. Now conveniently YouTubers always need someone to edit their videos. Once you're beyond maybe a few tens of thousands of subscribers maybe 20k plus basically every YouTuber would benefit from having an editor that they can outsource their editing to. And at that point most YouTubers are also making enough money to support the service. And at that point most YouTubers also don't enjoy editing themselves and so they're like desperate to find someone who can help them edit their videos. Now if someone is a YouTuber in that position they might be going on a website like Fiverr or Upwork or People per Hour and looking for an editor who they can outsource editing to. And I've done this a few times and hundreds of my students in the part time YouTuber Academy have done this as well. And what you find is that all of the response like 95% of the responses are absolute trash. I.e. people don't read the description properly they're completely unprofessional in their communication and they're just really bad at video editing. And so to stand out in one of these marketplaces it's actually reasonably straightforward. All you have to do is communicate well and actually read the brief that the person is given rather than copy and pasting it. Now that's one way of doing it where you're essentially waiting for people to come to you waiting for people to choose you. But there is another way of doing it. And that other way involves being a permissionless apprentice. So what you could do for example is you could find a YouTuber that you like is maybe on 50k to 250k subscribers. You can download one of their videos from YouTube and you can edit it in a different way. You can add in some more lower thirds some effects some titles and transitions some background music. And then what you can do is you can reach out to that YouTuber on Twitter or Instagram or email and say hey I'm a video editor I would love to edit videos for you. Here is an example of what I've done using some of your content. And if you do this with just a handful of YouTubers I can basically guarantee that at least one of them will respond and be like oh my god that sounds sick. Then the thing you ask them is like hey why don't you give me one of your raw videos and I'll edit it for you completely free of charge so you can see what my work is like. And then after that you know I charge $50 a video or $100 a video. And you're telling you're pricing up front so they know what the vibe is and they can decide can they afford this but you're offering to do that first video for free. So A they've already seen your skills because you've edited their video with our permission. B you're giving them this free trial so they can see how you're doing. And then if all that goes well they're going to be paying you lots of money to edit their videos. And this model of becoming a permissionless apprentice is applicable to loads of things other than video editing as well. You could become a podcast editor you could be a thumbnail artist like I'm just thinking in the realm of of creators here. You could be someone who converts someone's email newsletter into an Instagram carousel that they can post on their Instagram account. You can be someone who takes long form video content off of YouTube and turns it into 16 like 9 by 16 TikTok friendly content with the animations and the music and stuff. There's all of this stuff that you can do all it needs is number one having the skills which you can learn for free on the internet within a few days. And number two having a little bit of creativity and ingenuity and the ability to communicate well via email or via Twitter to find the people who are then going to ultimately pay you for the service. So how easy is this to start? Pretty easy. You just need to learn the skill again not very hard you can follow YouTube tutorials it takes about a weekend. How easy is it to make your first hundred dollars? Again not that hard to be honest probably two out of five stars because you can post a bunch of projects on Upwork and Fiverr and people per hour with these freelance websites and you can also just reach out to your YouTube or friends. So making a hundred dollars shouldn't be too hard in this context. But the only drawback with this is that it is pretty time intensive and I give this a five out of five in terms of time intensity because ultimately when you're selling a service like this you are kind of charging for your time and generally when you're charging for your time rather than building something and selling it where you're not charging for your time that tends to become pretty time intensive. All right side hustle number two is online tutoring and this is how most of my friends when we were at university made the bulk of our side hustle money through tutoring people on the internet and the best way to think about this is that wherever you are on your journey there's probably some stuff that you know that of someone a few years younger than you could benefit from. So for example when I was like 18 years old I signed up to this online tutoring agency and I started tutoring people it like kind of 15 to 17 year olds in maths and science. Then when I got to university sort of aged 19 through to 24 I was tutoring people who were applying to medical school helping them out with the entrance exams. I've got friends who are currently working as doctors who are doing online tutoring for medical students and a few friends who have completely random random jobs that they're doing but what they do tutoring in is in languages. So one of my friends for example speaks French natively and is an online French teacher so he teaches people French over the internet for about like 30 pounds an hour about 40 dollars an hour or something like that and this is actually pretty easy to do all it needs again that you need to have a skill or something that you have learned that someone else will will find valuable and then you just need to find people who are willing to pay for that skill. So usually you can sign up for an account for these online tutoring platforms the one in the UK I think that I used to use was called UK tutors and this is an example of another friend of mine from from Ed School who had one of these accounts on one of these like online tutoring websites and ended up tutoring someone who turned out to be the daughter of like some Nigerian royal family connection and then they liked him so much that they flew him out in their private jet like for a whole summer to tutor their kids while they were going to these cool places all around the world and he said that was a pretty sick experience. I'm not saying that if you stop online tutoring you're going to get that level of treatment but what I'm saying is that it's a very good way of teaching something that you know to people who are willing to pay for that thing to be taught to them. The other option along a similar vein is a website called iTalkie and I've got a few friends who teach like languages through that. It's kind of like a language teaching thing but it's not really teaching it's like if you speak English you can sign up for an account on iTalkie and people will pay for you to just have a conversation with them over Zoom in English and generally it's people from abroad who want to improve their English by having conversations with an English speaker. If you want to teach on iTalkie then it usually starts somewhere between four and eight dollars an hour but you can always up your prices over time and one friend I know is making I think a few hundred dollars a month from doing just like a few a few hours of iTalkie like English language tutoring each month and this stuff to be honest is pretty simple it's not easy because you need to have the skill and you need to be able to market yourself to get people to pay for that skill and then you need to actually be good at teaching the thing but to be honest there are no easy ways to make money like always to make money require an exchange of value in return for money and in this case the value you're providing is the the ability to teach something. Sometimes people get held back by thinking they need a formal teaching qualification but you don't need any formal qualifications this is one of those things where if you have learned something and you are just good at explaining it then you probably can teach teach that thing to someone you can practice on your friends you can practice on family practice on your kids practice on your colleagues whatever and so in terms of ease of getting started I'm going to give this a two out of five because you do need to have that skill to begin with but hey if you're watching this video you probably have some kind of skill that you can teach to someone over the internet it's not too hard to make your first hundred dollars I'm going to give this a two out of five all you have to do again is be able to market yourself appropriately on the various tutoring websites that are relevant to you but again the problem is that this is a pretty time intensive thing because you are doing a direct trade time for money and generally you're being paid by the hour so the more hours you put in the more money you're going to make. All right so side hustle idea number three is to actually become a website designer and to design websites for a niche group of clients how do you become a website designer these days is actually not that hard like back in the day when I was first learning web design you had to learn HTML and CSS and all that kind of stuff these days there are so many no code ways of building a website like Squarespace and Wix and I don't know these other like drag and drop type website builders that are pretty reasonable it's also pretty easy to learn WordPress you know WordPress powers like 30% of the internet you can download WordPress themes for free you can customize them for free they're not that hard and you can watch YouTube tutorials that teach you how to customize a WordPress theme so again within about probably I won't say a week and probably about a week you can learn how to make a website and how to make it look good if you're using something like Squarespace or Wix or WordPress so now you've got this skill that could be valuable to some people and now you just need to find people who are willing to pay you for the skill so the trick here is to not appeal to absolutely everyone but instead appeal to a very very very niche group of people so there are two people that I'm currently thinking of who have done this very well one of them is a guy who I connected with through this YouTube channel and he we in our here I met up for coffee about two years ago when I was in Cambridge turned out he had taught himself web design and he specialized in building websites for orthodontists in like one or two states in America like somewhere in the middle of America this is pretty niche like that was the only thing he provided he just reached out to all of the orthodontists in like Utah and some other state I can't I can't remember what and he said to them hey look you know I specialized in building websites for orthodontists I can make your website look prettier it'll increase your leads it'll help more people to sign up to your own visa line whatever whatever and after sending a few dozen cold emails he hopped on a few phone calls and then he ended up being paid like five hundred dollars to make his first orthodontist website then after that he went to other orthodontists in the area we like hey I've worked on this website here's what it looks like and it looked good and those other guys were like sick I want to hire you to build my orthodontist website and then he up just prices slowly over time to the point that he was able to travel the world literally just building websites for orthodontists and then the next thing he did after that was that he started going into like paid ads and helping them run their Google ads and so he was just like traveling the world making a living as a digital nomad starting off making websites for orthodontists and then selling ads for them and the cool thing about that is once you've built a website once you've got the themes you've got to know how it's actually not that hard building the same genre of website again just changing up the fonts and the colors and the vibe just to make it look a little bit different but the underlying structure is the same and so this is pretty easy to start it takes about a week to learn how to make a decent looking website but it is kind of hard getting your first client because you do have to put yourself out there and you know try and get some sales but then once you've done that making a hundred dollars is fairly easy but again the issue is that this is a fairly time intensive thing because you are kind of selling your time for money but one way you can level up the whole building websites thing is by actually specializing in building themes for other people to build websites with so I've got a friend called Dan who's the one who ended up sort of designing including my personal website he specializes in building themes for ghost which is a sort of niche kind of WordPress alternative that people can use to build websites now Dan builds these website themes and then he just sells them on ghost for like $50 $100 something like that and so he's making pretty healthy passive income every single day from people buying his website templates and this is the perfect example of doing the work once to create a thing and then being able to sell it multiple times without any further costs of selling the thing there's also been a new trend recently towards people building websites with notion yes notion like notion acts as a good content management system and then you can plug it into a website like super super dot s o link in the video description if you want to check it out and then people can just create a website off the back of a notion page and this is cool because then if you create themes for super then you can then sell those themes so you're doing the work to create the super theme once and then you're selling it to whoever wants to convert their notion page into looking at like a website like the theme that you've designed again this takes more effort you probably do need a bit of background encoding HTML CSS making stuff look a little bit pretty making sure the website theme actually works but again you know this is making money in order to make money you have to provide something useful and in this video hopefully i'm giving you lots of examples of useful things that you can provide to people who are willing to pay for them all right side hustle idea number four is in fact social media consulting now if you're watching this then you're probably under the age of 30 which means that you probably know more about social media than people who are over the age of 30 and conveniently it just so happens that most businesses in the world are run by people over the age of 30 and basically every business in the world needs some kind of social media presence so just by virtue of being of a certain generation you'll automatically have a sort of by default a bit of a background in social media and you can always learn a bit more in a weekend by just reading a ton of blog posts and watching a ton of YouTube videos at this point you can now advertise your services as a social media consultant you can go to businesses in your local area or wherever who don't have a very good social media presence and you can offer consulting to them you can be like hey i specialize in social media consulting i will give you all the advice you need to do you need to grow your instagram or your facebook or your linkedin or whatever and then these businesses who are generally run by people over the age of 30 would be like oh that's kind of cool we need to get better at linkedin but we don't know how to do it we need to get better at Instagram but we can't be bothered can you tell us what we need to do and so you can hop on a call with them you can give them a free half an hour and then you can be like yeah sure you know i charged three hundred dollars a month as like a retainer fee and that gives you one phone call every month or one zoom call every month where i analyze your social media presence and i give you tips and what you can do now that's pretty good because now you're getting paid on retainer for these businesses which are going to be actively reaching out to and you're hopefully giving them genuinely valuable advice about growing the social media presence because you're you've got a skill you've actively learned ways to improve that skill and now you're offering it to people who can pay for it i.e. businesses but then what might happen is that you might get into a point fairly quickly where people where businesses are like you know what you seem to know what you're talking about what would it take for you to just manage your social media accounts and at this point you can be like ah well i actually offer a fully done for you service where i will take over your social media accounts and manage them for you and help you grow your Instagram and your LinkedIn and whatever i charge two thousand dollars a month for that retainer service and for that you get three Instagram posts and one LinkedIn post every week which i will completely sort out all i need is just a zoom call with you once a month to get some content off of you and this is in fact what one of our subcontractors does the who who works with us he charges a few thousand dollars a month and we pay him to do social media consulting and we started off paying him to do social media consulting but then we ended up basically saying to him hey we actually need to do a bunch of this stuff for social media can you help us and actually do some of it yourself so now Joe's built his own agency model out of this where he does this for other clients as well and it all started with this like young 21 year old guy being like hey i know a lot about social media let me reach out to people who i know need help with social media and let's figure out how i can make a business from this so how easy is it to start well if you're under the age of 30 very because you already know about social media you just need to brush up on it a little bit more and like keep keep keep track of what the latest practices and you know latest trends are how easy is it to make you first hundred dollars again pretty easy i'd give this probably a two out of five stars all you have to do is find a business because businesses make money and businesses need a social media presence what you don't want to do is try and target individuals who are not making money because no individual wants to spend money to grow their social media presence it's only a business that wants to spend money to grow the social media presence and the cool thing in terms of time intensiveness i'm actually going to give this like a two out of five for time intensiveness because once you've done it once and yes you're trading your time for money by doing these hourly consulting gigs but if you can get some clients and do social media management for them suddenly you can use this whole suite of apps like buffer and remix and you know other things like that to schedule social media posts you can use things like canva or photoshop or figmar to bulk create assets so that maybe for one day a month you're doing the work to kind of manage three social media accounts and then you're scheduling everything to come out across that month and then you're not having to do much more beyond that so in terms of time intensive like the time for money trade it is actually pretty good all right side hustle idea number five is similar to this consultant thing except it's going more specific and it's to become a notion consultant if you know if a million notion is an app that's taking the world by storm i'm not going to talk too much about it i've made loads of videos about it but basically again lots of businesses need to have their business processes like streamlined and operationalized and need to have stuff converted into standard operating procedures especially if there's small businesses that have maybe somewhere between three and ten employees they probably don't have a very good system behind how they're running their business now an app like notion is absolutely fantastic for building an internal wiki and internal processes and internal standard operating procedures and stuff and so if you can learn how to use notion and learn a little bit about how businesses operate in terms of SOPs and structure and all chart design and all that kind of stuff what you can then start to do is advertise your services as a notion business consultant to local businesses you're not giving them a specific advice for their specific niche or industry all you're doing is like taking the things they're already doing you're going into their business you're asking a few questions and you're turning things into notion pages and you're trying to streamline their workflows we actually have a guy who's like a notion consultant type person working in the team with us who's helping us kind of revamp our content production pipeline we're paying him a large amount of money to be able to do this because he knows a lot about notion and because even though me and a bunch of other team members we know a lot about notion as well we just don't really have the time to think about the sort of operationalizing and systemizing of a whole structure as much as this guy does and there's a bunch of people on Twitter doing this sort of thing so there's Daniel Knozah, Marie Poulin, Optimization, there's August Bradley whose YouTube channel you might be familiar with if we look on Upwork as well you know notion consulting is now a thing and people seem to be charging around 30 to 70 dollars an hour for notion consulting and again you do it's not that hard to become a notion consultant you just need to watch a bunch of YouTube videos and play around with notion for like a week or so and then you'll become better at using notion than like 99% of people using notion who are not actively trying to improve their notion skills and again it's back to our model you have this service which is valuable to people who are willing to pay for it i.e. businesses and now you're reaching out to people who might need that service and then you can charge them money for it maybe you'll get your first client for free or for a hundred dollars at 20 dollars at 30 dollars here and there that's totally fine you're building up a portfolio and then as you go to more businesses you can say hey I have helped these other businesses sort of streamline their notion and here as a testimonial from them would you like me to do the same for you and they'd be like yeah sure come on in and we'll pay you some money so how easy is it to start and i'm going to give this like probably a one out of five notion is pretty easy to learn there's tons and tons of YouTube tutorials and courses that you can take on how to get better with notion and just by playing around and building your own systems and stuff you'll be able to have a working knowledge of notion enough to be able to help businesses with it how easy is to make the first hundred dollars i would give this a one out of five if people on upwork are charging 30 to 70 dollars an hour for notion consulting you can probably also do the same provided you have decent communication and how time intensive this is really depends on how much time you actually want to be putting in you could just do this part time consulting service and trade your time for money by charging i don't know 40 dollars an hour or something like that or you could do what like optimization and august Bradley and repuling and stuff and sort of turn it into a whole full time thing with like your own courses and your own consulting and packages and that kind of stuff and then it becomes very time intensive so it really depends on how much effort you want to put into this particular side hustle all right so side hustle idea number six is actually to become a writer for businesses or youtubers or creators or entrepreneurs or anyone who needs stuff written for them now the key thing to remember here is that business writing is not the same as like writing an essay in english literature class or in like you know a dissertation or anything like that it's generally business writing is writing for clarity so for example let's use our orthodontist thing let's say you're an orthodontist in i don't know i was going to say you tell but i'm going to say i'm going to use something in the UK let's say you're an orthodontist in Cambridge and you want to attract clients to your orthodontist thing now one way of doing that is by having a website and having a blog and doing this thing called content marketing which is basically where you write high quality blog posts explaining stuff regarding orthodontist type things and then when people search orthodontist Cambridge or they search in visor line Cambridge or something like that your blog post explaining the benefits of in visor line Cambridge might come up and so let's say you're like my orthodontist whose name is dr. scriven who is based in angli orthodontics in Cambridge and you want to increase your like website presence and search engine optimization and social media and stuff you're probably looking to hire someone to write articles for you let explain things like how in visor line works and how the different treatments work and what's the difference between this type of tooth thing and that type of tooth thing like whatever the niche is but if you're an orthodontist and you've got your own team of nurses and stuff and stuff you probably don't have time to write these articles yourself so you'd really love to hire someone to write these articles for you and basically every business that has a website knows that they should have blog posts where they're doing this content marketing type stuff and so if you're at all good at writing writing with clarity rather than writing like flowerfully and like fancy and stuff just like simple clear concise writing if you're good at that sort of thing you can then offer that service which is valuable to businesses who are willing to pay for the thing it's also not just businesses who are willing to pay for that you know we've got four writers on our team right now who help writing things like you know doing research for YouTube videos writing out writing articles for the website helping convert like videos for our youtuber academy into text helping convert stuff into tweet threads that kind of stuff there's a lot of writing support that bigger youtubers need as well because we know that we want to be across all these different platforms but like for me you know i'm spending all my time writing my book and making these videos i don't really want to spend the time writing articles for LinkedIn as well and so i can outsource that to someone else who can convert my youtube videos into an article for LinkedIn for example to be honest like it's probably kind of hard finding youtubers who are at that size that they're they want to do this thing and hire someone for the website but basically all businesses with a website would be very willing to have a content writer as a freelancer as a part-time thing who can write them high quality articles that'll help them rank for SEO and so how easy is this to get started i would say probably two out of five you need to again again i would just use the the permissionless apprentice model i would find like a niche maybe orthodontist in your local area or dentist in the local area or i don't know private cosmetic surgeons in the local area and say to them like hey i'm a writer i specialize in writing articles for this heroine is exact heroine is an example of an article that i could write for you all i would need is half an hour of your time once a month where i can just mine content ideas from you and then i'll turn those into articles which will be great for your social media it'll be great for your website great for your LinkedIn that kind of stuff how easy is it to make your first hundred dollars well once you found that client through the permissionless apprentice model then making your first hundred dollars should be pretty easy because again we are targeting businesses who have money really when it comes to building or any of these side hustles we don't want to be trying to target people who don't have money so for example if i was thinking of a new side hustle there is no point in me targeting 13 year olds because 13 year olds famously do not have money whereas if i was targeting 33 year old business owners those guys definitely do have money and so i can target them and in like a nice way not in a way and they'll they're they're the ones who are able and willing to pay me for the service side hustle idea number seven is to start a paid email newsletter now i was going to talk about this in depth but this video has already gone on long enough and so if you want to find out more about this i've actually interviewed a bunch of people who have made a living through writing in various forms and those interviews are from live streams that i did back in lockdown and all of those are available on nebula now if you haven't heard nebula is an independent streaming platform that's built by me and a bunch of other creators and on nebula we can put content like long ass videos like this one without having to worry about stuff being too niche or too long for the youtube algorithm and so on nebula i have like a bunch of interviews from writers and entrepreneurs and creators that i did during lockdown that you can see in their entirety and i've got a bunch of other exclusive content nebula including my workflow series which shows how i use the abs notion and room to like optimize my workflow for productivity and creativity now the best way to get access to nebula is to sign up to a subscription of curiosity stream who are very kindly sponsoring this video if you haven't heard curiosity stream is the world's leading documentary streaming subscription platform and on curiosity stream they've got thousands of high quality high budget documentaries from all sorts of topics from science and technology to religion to history to food to everything in between and because curiosity stream love independent creators we've actually got a bundle deal with nebula so that if you sign up for curiosity stream which is less than 15 dollars for the whole year you get free access to nebula bundled with that and so for less than 15 dollars you get access to these thousands of amazing high quality documentaries and you also get access to a bunch of exclusive content from me and a bunch of other creators that you might be familiar with if that sounds good then head over to curiositystream.com forward slash alley and if you sign up there then your login details for nebula will be emailed to you and then you can check out all of these like live stream interviews that i've done with all these writers creators entrepreneurs online builders about how they made money how they built their brands and how they did all the cool stuff that they now do so those were six and a bit side hustle ideas that you can start in 2022 if you like this you might like to check out that video which is nine passive income ideas that's the video that went viral last year that had loads and loads of comments and replies to it and so thank you very much for watching do please hit the subscribe button if you want already and i'll hopefully see you in the next video bye bye",
	" Okay, so if you spend any amount of time on YouTube, you possibly wondered at some point how much money do these YouTubers actually make? Is it related to how many views or how many subscribers are all these different factors? So in this episode of oversharing, I'm gonna break down exactly how much money I make from YouTube and I'll be explaining how this whole thing works so that if you want to get into it, you can or if you're just really curious, you can indulge your curiosity. We'll start by talking about the logistics of how people actually earn money on YouTube and how it works, and then we'll talk about the three main factors that affect how much an individual earns on YouTube, and then we'll go under the hood and I'll be exposing all of my analytics for the last three years, so you can see how much money I really make. So to start making money on YouTube, you first have to join the YouTube Partners program, which means these days you need to have at least a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of total watch time on YouTube. So you can't start monetizing the instant you turn on your channel. Once you've hit those landmarks, then you can apply for the program, and if you're approved for it, you can then turn on ads on your videos. This is optional, but when you turn on ads, and people will probably usually see a five-second ad before the video, and might see some mid-roll ads during the video, and possibly a five-second ad after the video. And the idea is that YouTube sells these ad slots to advertisers through their Google Ads program, so advertisers can then pay to show their ads on different types of content, and they might want to do it based on a whole load of different factors. Now, the problem is that when you are very small on YouTube, you actually aren't really earning very much money at all. And I recognize this, so for me when I started my YouTube channel in June 2017, I made 77 videos before I turned on monetization. I think I turned on monetization around about April 2018, because to my mind, making five or ten dollars a month from YouTube was just not worth the annoyance for the audience in watching the ads. But if that number was going to be $500 a month, at that point, it would be worth subjecting the audience to the annoyance of ads, because it was making me a significant amount of money. And so, for example, from June 2017 up until April 2018, I had 340,000 views, 8.3,000 subscribers, and I made \u00a31.96 in total across that. But then when I turned on monetization, for the next six months from April 2018 to September 2018, in total, I made \u00a36,142.00. So that's the logistics out of the way. Let's not talk about the three factors that affect how much money you earn on YouTube. And the most important of those is actually watch time. So watch time is quite important both from a revenue perspective and also from a YouTube algorithm perspective. So from a revenue perspective, it's important because the longer people are watching your videos, the more opportunity they have to see ads. But from a YouTube algorithm perspective, watch time is interesting because although no one quite knows exactly how the YouTube algorithm works, the YouTube creator team have hinted like a lot of it is based on watch time. Like if your videos are making people watch for longer and also stay on YouTube as a platform for longer, then your videos are more likely to be recommended by the algorithm. And so that's partly why these audience retention graphs that we see in our YouTube studio, these are so important. And if we look at like my four previous videos, you can see the audience retention graphs are really not very good. Like for most of these videos, even for the ones that I think are pretty good, we're dropping off to about like maybe only one or one in five people are actually watching all the way through to the end of the video. And you can see there's a significant decline right at the start. Usually this is because people click on a video within five seconds, they realize it can't be, it can't be bothered towards the video. So they go away from it. So you get this precipitous decline. And then you get a general decline as you go through the video. It just shows that you know, there's nothing in particular that's making people click away from it. It's just that people are slowly attritioning over time. In fact, some people say that the more viral a video gets, the less your audience retention is going to be good. Like for example, in one of my recent videos called How I Type Really Fast, which amazingly went viral, loads of people watching that video are people who don't know who I am, they're not subscribed to my channel. Therefore, there are a lot less likely to watch 17 minutes of me spouting all about something or another, which is why the audience retention graphs for that particular video looks so abysmal, even though that video had a lot of views. Let's have a look at some of my more popular videos and we can see how watch time relates to revenue. So for example, if we compare the video of my productivity desk setup with the video of which iPad should you buy, the desk setup video has made about 1700 pounds with 1.4 million views and the iPad video has made 2,246 pounds with 1.3 million views. So that's kind of weird, like the iPad video has made more money even though it has fewer views. But if we look at the watch time, the desk setup only has 75,000 hours, which is quite a lot, but the iPad video has 124,000 hours, so it's about a 50% increase. But then on top of that, we also have an extra feature which is mid-roll ads. This was something that Google and YouTube introduced a few years ago and that meant that on any video above 10 minutes, you could have mid-roll ads. So sometimes those are ads that are, you know, there's little like auction like banner ads that appear in the middle of video. At other times, they're more annoying, like 5 second ads that interrupt your video. That you have to skip and then you can watch the rest of the video. But crucially, this only applies to videos that were over 10 minutes long and so a lot of YouTubers realized this and started kind of artificially inflating the length of their videos to make it more than 10 minutes. For example, if we take a look at my YouTuber friend and colleague Shelby Church, she's done a video where she breaks down how much money she makes off YouTube and she looks at the difference between a 9 minute and a 10 minute video. And she found that her videos that are over 10 minutes earn over three times as much revenue as the videos that are under 10 minutes. So it makes such a big change, which is what kind of incentivizes YouTubers to have longer videos just so they can get these mid-roll ads in. And actually recently in the last couple of months, YouTubers made a change whereby you now only need to be 8 minutes long before you can start adding mid-roll ads. So I suspect people are going to be less keen to inflate above 10 minutes and now a little bit more keen to inflate above 8 minutes. So the second thing that determines how much money you're going to make is the type of content and that's what dictates the CPM or cost per meal, which is Latin for like cost per thousand views or something like that. And the CPM changes on a lot of things, but mostly it's based on how much advertisers are willing to pay to target a certain type of video. And so depending on the topic, you would get different rates. So let's say I make a video about, I don't know, like a fantasy books that I like, the sorts of companies that are advertising those videos, probably don't have a lot of money. They're probably book publishing companies, stuff like that. Whereas if you were to make a video about finance or real estate or credit cards, the companies that advertise them, those sorts of videos, have loads of money to burn and so your CPM rates are going to be higher. So in general, for most YouTubers, the CPM is around three to seven dollars per thousand views. But if you pick the right sort of video topic, it can go up to about 30 or 40 dollars per thousand views, which is absolutely huge. For example, most of my videos are in the three to seven pounds range. But if we look at Shelby Church's video where she talks about how to make money using Amazon's FBA fulfilled by Amazon program, that's a prime video for advertisers to target because it's a video about making money online and therefore loads of people who have courses about making money online are going to target that particular audience. And we can see from her channel that she says her playback based CPM was $35.60, which is absolutely enormous. And so she's making more than 10 times as much money as she would be making on a different kind of topic video, just purely based on the choice of topic. Unfortunately, the CPM doesn't actually go to the creator. YouTube tends to take a 45% cut of CPMs. And so if your CPM is $10, you're actually only going to get $6.50 of that amount. And that leads to a new metric that they recently introduced called RPM, which is revenue per meal. And that is a more accurate idea of how much money you as the creator are taking home from these videos. The third major thing that influences how much money we make on videos is the role of sponsors. Now essentially if a video is sponsored, then at some point during the video, the creator is going to make some kind of spiel. So for example, I might say that if you want to start your own journey of making money online, one of the best ways of doing that is by learning how to code. To learn how to code, you should start by teaching yourself HTML and CSS. And then you should learn a server-side language like Python. And actually the best way to learn Python is by following an online course over at Brilliant, who are very kindly sponsoring this video. If you don't know, Brigham is an amazing platform with online courses for maths, science, and computer science. And their introduction to Python and advanced Python series is actually a really good interactive fun way of learning how to code in Python. And then once you learn how to code in Python, you can basically build anything from a simple website all the way through to machine learning algorithms. You know, it's one of the most popular programming languages in the world. And Brilliant is a great place to learn that. They've also got fantastic courses on maths and science. They've recently got one about uncertainty, which is all about kind of navigating probability and uncertain world. So if that sounds up your street, you should definitely head over to brilliant.org forward slash Ali. And the first 200 people to click that link will get 20% of the annual premium subscription. So thank you, Brilliant, for sponsoring this video. That's an example of a sponsored message. And so Brilliant are going to pay me a certain amount of money for plugging that within my video. And that massively changes how much money I'm going to be making from this video. A few things kind of complicated. So firstly, most contracts with sponsors say that you're not allowed to say how much money you're making from them. So I'm not allowed to tell you how much money Brilliant have paid me to do that particular sponsored plug. But with some channels, like Casey Neistat, for example, he says he makes between $10,000 and $100,000 per video. As in like more than $100,000. Even though he's absolutely huge, he's a lot bigger than I am. But it just kind of gives you an idea of the numbers to get thrown around. And in fact, a lot of huge YouTubers make more than $100,000 per sponsored video, which is just insane. So we've talked about the different factors that influence how much money YouTubers make. Let me now take you inside my YouTube studio, my YouTube studio app thingy. And I'll show you how much money I've been making from each of the videos. And we'll talk about that a little bit more. So this is the lifetime revenue of my YouTube channel since about June 2017 when I first tied up loading videos. And so we can see that for the first absolutely ages, I'm making sometimes one penny per day. But basically I'm not making anything until April 2018. I think it was 17th April. I remember this day when I turned on monetization. And so now I'm going from making absolutely nothing per day to making, you know, 11 pounds, 8 pounds, 9 pounds, 16 pounds. So immediately, you know, having already been a YouTube of like nine months at this point and having made 77 videos already, I'm now making sort of between five and 15 pounds a day off of YouTube ads, which at the time was was pretty great. Like I was already feeling like I was winning at life because that pays for a takeaway every single day if I want to. And that just felt like, you know, it kind of felt like cheating, but I can basically eat for free now that I have a YouTube channel, which is quite nice. So we can see in May 2018, 16 pounds, 72. And then kind of dropping down to three pounds, three pounds, 68, 10 pounds. And then we start in June 2018. I think this was when I made my iPad video. Yeah, this was a special video. How I take notes of my iPad at medical school. But as soon as that video comes out, suddenly my revenue sky rockets from five pound, 91 and four pounds, 69 a day, all the way up to sometimes 60 pounds a day and 40 pounds a day and 70 pounds a day. And again, this really felt like cheating at the time because I was like, I can't believe I'm making this much money off YouTube. I'm making like 50 pounds a day. That was like 1500 quid a month. And that just felt again, like, this is amazing. I'm making real actual money from YouTube. It's not just a few pennies here and there. This is 1500 pounds a month. This is actually a large amount of money over time. We can see that it doesn't really change much for the next like year. So for around 12 months after that, I was sort of hovering between the, you know, making a few dozen pounds a day off of YouTube ads, which was still pretty good. But then like over time, we can see that the graph really starts to increase. So in throughout 2019, the rate bumps up a bit. So some days are making over 100 pounds a day, which is again, absolutely insane. And then you know, we've got a 97, 88, 95, 100, 100 all the way through to September 2019. And then what's really cool about this graph is just how much of an exponential rise it's been over the last six months. Basically, since lockdown started. So I think kind of lockdown was pretty good for me on the YouTube channel because now all of a sudden, those are more people are watching, sitting down and watching videos. And now we can see that these days, you know, for example, Friday, the 3rd of July, 578 pounds in a single day. That's pretty good. Sunday, 23rd of August, 2020, 711 pounds in a day. If you told me, a couple of years ago, I was going to make 700 quid in a day from YouTube ads. I would literally have had a stroke. And I would have thought, that go for him. This is not going to happen. It's a very much like a lot of sort of slow and steady, slow and steady. And then all of a sudden, suddenly it starts to grow. And that's only really happened in the last six months. It's one of those weird things whereby it almost feels like like playing a video game where your character starts off kind of on level one and you can't kill anything. And then you can start kind of killing some stuff. But then at some point, you get to kind of what feels like the end of game where your character starts getting a lot more powerful. And suddenly, you can just kind of do all these things that you kind of done before. And that's kind of what it feels like on the sort of exponential growth of YouTube revenue. And if we kind of put this down to the last 28 days, we see, yeah, estimated revenue in the last 28 days, 11,618 pounds, whereas estimated revenue over the lifetime was about 90,000. So in the last one month, I've made about 10%, 11, 12% revenue compared to the last like three years, which is pretty good going. And we can see here that the CPM that cost per meal is \u00a35.50. But the actual revenue per meal is only \u00a31.68. And that's because loads of people have ad block. It's because YouTube takes a cart and all these different factors. So yeah, last 28 days, 11,618 pounds. This is pretty good. For context, my junior doctor salary was about \u00a33,000 a month, like pre-tax. This is also pre-tax. So this is three and a bit times more than my monthly doctor salary. If you want to see how much money I've made from other sources, that video, how much money I make in a week as a doctor and YouTuber will be linked in a little playlist over there, along with a couple of other videos about how to make money online and how you can get started on this journey of hashtag passive income. Thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye-bye.",
	" If you've got any money left in your bank account by the time you die, you have done something wrong. That is the core message of this book, die with zero. And it's pretty controversial, but it's actually genuinely changed my approach to spending and saving money, which is why we're talking about it in this episode of Book Club, the ongoing series where we distill and discuss highlights from some of my favorite books. What is the core argument here? Well, what Bill Perkins says, the author of the book, is that we all need to make money to survive, like buying food and like paying rent and stuff. And once we've covered our basic needs, then we use that time and money that we've got left over from survival to essentially buy more meaningful experiences and fulfilling experiences like traveling or going to the cinema or smashing the like button for the YouTube algorithm. Now, if we assume that beyond having the basics covered, life is about having fulfilling and enriching and meaningful experiences, then in an ideal world, we would just trade in our life energy directly for those experiences. But in the real world, we have this thing called money as a middleman between life energy and fulfilling experiences. Now, most of us don't know when we're going to die, but let's say we happen to die at the age of 85, let's say $10,000 left in the bank. That money represents two things. So firstly, it's the extra several months that we worked to earn that post tax $10,000. And secondly, that 10k represents all of the experiences that we didn't spend that money on, like going on five holidays or 50 fancy restaurant meals, or even just a few extra months of retirement. Bill Perkins would basically say that all of this life energy that we traded has basically been wasted because all of that money that we earned is just gathering dust, and it's not useful to us at all, once we're dead. Now, this raises a bunch of questions like what if you run out of money when you're old? What about leaving money to your kids? What about giving money to charity? And these are all good questions that we're going to cover in this video. Bill is very careful to mention in the book that if you have no disposable income, then by definition, you need to spend your money right now just to survive, so you're probably already using your money as efficiently as you can. In which case, this book is really not for you right now. Bill thinks that, especially when we're around 20s and 30s, that we should spend more money on fun, exciting things like going on adventures and doing cool stuff with friends and attending you-guilt ornaments all around the world. And there are three main reasons for this. Earning power, memory dividends, and old age. The first reason for investing in experiences early is that our earning power generally increases as we get older. So what seems like a big chunk of money when we're 20 years old is much less significant when we're 40 years old with the houses and kids that establish career and a lot more money coming in. Now, this is a crucial insight. Here we can see that as our earning power goes up, our happiness from spending $20 or whatever that number is actually goes down over time. And so if you're young, i.e. in your teens or your 20s, then in a way, you don't really need to overly obsess about saving lots of money because that money could be better spent on experiences right now, rather than that same amount of money being spent on experiences 40 years from now, where it's going to matter to you a lot less. The idea here is that every year, good experiences that we've had in the past give us a return on investment because every positive experience we have also creates memories in addition to the experience itself. If, for example, you and your friends have gone this amazing two-month hike through Italy when you're 20 years old, then you'll probably have at least 50 more years to enjoy those memories and reminisce on the trip whenever you're hanging out and reflect on the lessons you've learned from it and all of that fun stuff. Now, if instead you decided that you weren't going to take that two-month trip and instead hustle at work for an extra two months to make a little bit more money to save up a little bit more money, and then you would go on that trip when you're 40 years old, for example, then yes, sure you'll be a little bit more financially secure because of that extra two months of earnings, but you'll have missed out on almost 20 years of good memories and extra life experience and good vibes as well. When we're older, then we naturally can't do all of the things that we actually want to do, and even if we can afford it, we might not be fit and healthy enough to actually really enjoy the thing. So, if we were to create this kind of graph, then this is generally what a spending power looks like as we're getting older, and this is generally what our health looks like as we get older as well. And if you're in slightly worse health, it might even look something like that. And basically, it's almost an inverse relationship between how much money we can make over time and how healthy we actually are to enjoy that experience as we get older. All right, so basically, what he's saying so far is spend lots of money on experiences when you're young. Now, that does seem a bit suspicious, but one thing he says repeatedly is that his whole vibe is I'm not actually telling you to literally die with zero in the bank account. I'm just saying that if you think of it as a big idea and that you are aiming to die with zero, then it actually makes you think twice about what you're doing with your money and what you're doing with your life. Because to be honest, for most of us, if we are high-owners, then we tend to have this very profound tendency to over-save and underspend because we are very risk-averse and we tend to think that, hey, making money and saving it for the future is way more important than enjoying it right now. Now, this book doesn't have all of the answers but any means, but let's talk about some of the common objections to this idea to basically spend more money. Objection number one, what if I run out of money? This is the idea of longevity risk. And really, the whole point of saving is that it's usually so-of-eight you can get a house because society has told us that we need to buy house and be so that we don't run out of money when we're older. Nobody wants to die early, but no one wants to die after their retirement money either. But the thing is, apparently, most people who do save, actually save way too much and spend much less during their retirement than they thought. Bill Puggins incites a bunch of figures and studies and stuff in the book, which you're more than welcome to check out if you want, but the main point is that depending on various things, we fear running out of money a lot more than it's actually likely that we will genuinely run out of money. Objection number two, what about the kids? Surely, dying with zero is a really selfish thing to do because surely you want to leave money to your kid, right? Well, what Bill says and I totally agree is that if you do want to give money to your kids, you should give it to them when they're young, rather than when you'd die. Because if we only give away money when we die, then our kids will be around 60 when they get their inheritance. And this is bad because when you're 60 years old and you get a big windfall, it doesn't actually help you that much. Because at that point, you're already established, you've already got a job, you've got your own earning power, and you can enjoy that money a lot less when you're 60. Whereas, if you get that big windfall of money when you're somewhere between 25 and 35, that general age group, then that windfall is ridiculously helpful. And now you can do things like put down a deposit on a house or invest in starting your own company or afford to have kids now that you have some kind of financial safety net. And actually having those amazing life experiences instead of grinding away your 20s, trying to make rent and potentially making bad decisions like choosing a job you don't like because you need the money to survive. Objection number three, what about charity? The same thing goes for charity, to be honest, charities need money right now. People are dying in the world right now. The environment is suffering right now. And so waiting until you die to then arbitrarily give away money to charity at that date is a bit pointless. You might as well give money to the charities again while you're alive. And this is very much an idea that Bill talks about in the book. Die with zero does not mean do not give any money to good causes do not mean give any money to your kids. It means do it before you die because it's way more effective before you die than after you die. Okay, so those were the main objections and now we know the main idea of the book that we should be a little bit less concerned with trying to save loads of money that will never spend. And instead lean towards a little bit more towards spending money and actually allowing ourselves to spend money on those experiences, especially when we're young. Let's now look at some concrete things that we can do with that information. Tip one, time bucket your life. This is a really cool thing that he talks about in the book. Basically the idea is that at each stage of our life we're going to have different levels of the three main resources that we need for good life experiences. And those three resources are free time, money and health. If we made a diagram showing how much of each thing we have at different stages of our life on average, it would look something like this. When we're young, we are generally time millionaires as they say. We have loads of time and we have loads of health, but we have very little money. When we say 31 to 60 years old on average, we have a decent amount of time, a decent amount of health and a decent amount of money. And generally when we are 60 plus, we probably have loads of money and loads of time, but not that much health and energy. And so what Bill says, and I very much agree with this, I think it's great advice, is that it does make sense to have different time buckets for each part of your life so that you can use these resources most appropriately at each different stage. Here's how it works on paper. Now, Bill says that you should chop your life into these chunks of five to ten years and then decide what experiences you'd like to have in each part. If you really want to cycle across Asia or get into rock climbing skiing or whatever, you should probably try and do that before you're 50 years old while you're definitely fit and active enough to actually do it. And if there's expensive but non-active things that you'd like to do someday, but which aren't a priority right now, then it makes sense to put them down for when you're older and you have plenty of time and money and don't need so much energy. For example, a cruise tip number two, be bold not foolish. Bill's second piece of practical advice in the book is that we should take our biggest risks when we're young and don't have much to lose. If, for example, you take a calculated risk when you're young, then you've got a lot more time to build yourself back up if it fails and you've got a whole lifetime where you can enjoy the profits if the risk pays off. And so this risk reward ratio is very asymmetric with the reward very much in your favor when you're young. For example, if you gamble a thousand dollars on starting a small business when you're 20 and it fails, then who cares? You can easily earn that money back in the future because you can always make more money but you can never make more time. But if the business actually takes off, then it might actually boost your financial life to the proverbial moon as our crypto friends say. And the same thing goes for moving to a new city or some other big life decision that has some kind of big upside but that is a bit of a risk. If it doesn't go well, you've still got plenty of time to recover, provided you take that risk when you're young. Bill also points out that the downside of not even taking the chance is emotional, potentially a lifetime of wondering what if. And so even if things don't turn out successfully, we usually learn from that and we usually have positive memories of times when we gave something 100% of our efforts even though it was a bit of a risk. And then when we're older, these big financial risks are generally not worth taking because it can leave us with not enough money to retire and not enough time to make that money back. So I really like this book and I think there are some interesting lessons that we can learn from it, provided we don't take it too literally and don't get too but hurt that oh my god he's telling me to spend more money and my circumstances mean I can't spend that money. And like the whole point of these non-fiction self-help books is that they can give us ideas for what we could do with our life if we want to follow them but you don't have to. He's not forcing anyone to follow this method. And so I think there is like you have to take this kind of stuff with a bit of a pinch of salt. But there's a few things where I kind of disagree with some of the stuff that he says. Firstly, money does not necessarily equal life energy. This is Bill's main point at the start of the book that the money in your bank account equals your life energy. But with passive income for example, a small initial effort can snowball and can create more and more wealth almost effortlessly. For example, if you follow the advice of another book that I reviewed called The Millionaire Fastlane linked up there somewhere and you end up growing these kind of passive income money trees as they say, then you could theoretically end up as a millionaire with loads of money in your account without necessarily having worked a day beyond your 30th birthday. And that money then doesn't actually represent significant wasted life energy in the same way as for example working 50 years in a job that you really hate. With me for example, I spend a bunch of my youth working. But to be honest, building a business, making websites, growing this YouTube channel, playing World of Warcraft, interviewing people, on the podcast. This is all still technically work but I would still do these things even if I won the lottery because I love doing them so much and so I don't really see that as an exchange of money for life energy. Secondly, money equals optionality. So liquidity, I eat having easily accessible cash in the bank or in safe investments, is a big asset in itself because you can act quickly and decisively if some kind of cool opportunity comes up or if there is some kind of sudden emergency. Basically, you keep your options open and so yeah, optionality is good but as Bill says in the book, there is a risk of going too far with it and someone might completely rationally hold on to a large amount of money all the way up to their death just to keep their options open and then obviously it's not at all useful to you if you haven't exercised that option before you die. And then finally, the third weakness I see in the book is that he talks a lot about spending your money on experiences but not enough about investing your money in education which is exactly what you can do if you sign up with Skillshare who are very kindly sponsoring this video. You must have heard this by now. I talk about Skillshare all the time.

	" Hey guys welcome back to the channel, if you're new here my name is Ali, I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I want to share 10 top tips for entrepreneurs. So this is stuff that I picked up over the last six years of running a business called 6MET while I was a medical student at Cambridge University. That business has made about 800,000 pounds of top line revenue over the last six years and if you convert that into dollars it becomes a million dollars. Anyway in this video I'll start off by briefly sharing the story of how my friends and I started this company and how it grew and then I'll go over 10 top tips for students or anyone else interested in starting your own business becoming an entrepreneur making money online all of that good jazz. So I'll keep this part of the video brief because it's not really a story time video. Basically in our second year of medical school me and some friends decided it would be cool to run a course for one of the medical school admissions tests called the B-MAT. We'd been on a few courses ourselves run by big corporations, we thought they were a bit crap and they were charging lots of money so we thought we could do a better job and charge less money and also we could give out free places to students from low income backgrounds and when we started we thought it would just be like a small scale thing we thought we'd just kind of run a course at our local mosque but then quite early on I had the idea that because I'd been making websites and stuff since like the age of 12 why don't we just make a website for this and try and market it nationally and then we'll get people up and down the country to join our courses rather than just people in our local town. And so from that we made the course material we made the website we ran five sold out courses that year to about 120 students and then we were like oh my god this is amazing so the following year we expanded into the UCAT course and then we made a course for medical school interviews and then those did really really well so then we decided to make a question bank for the beamer and for the UCAT and those did really well and so every year this company kept on growing we kept on getting more students we expanded our locations we taught a course in Singapore we taught a course in Hong Kong we taught a course in the Netherlands and it turned into this like surprisingly big thing but now let's talk about the value of this video which is 10 top tips for entrepreneurs. So tip number one is don't wait for permission and often when we're starting something or when we're thinking of starting a business or a YouTube channel or a blog or anything like that we all have in our minds this issue of I'm just not qualified like why would anyone care what I have to say and in a way we're kind of waiting for someone to give us permission or waiting for like an official degree to say we're qualified or a certificate from someone to say that we're allowed to do this thing but like over the last six seven years of running this company I've realized and my friends have realized that there are so few domains in which you actually need to be qualified before you can create some kind of product like obviously you know if you're a doctor you need to be qualified before you can start treating patients but in most realms of business you can pretty much just start doing it whenever you want and if you're providing a good service and people are happy to pay you money for it and leaving good reviews that's all the qualification you really need. Secondly I think it's really important when doing this whole business start up entrepreneur making money online thing to stand on the shoulders of the giants that have come before us. Entrepreneurship in business isn't really a new thing anymore like it's it's a very well-trodden path that people have been doing for decades if not centuries and only in the last few decades we've got loads and loads of books podcasts websites articles interviews with people who have set up their own businesses and those people have done a really good job of sharing all the things they know so specific resources that you'll find helpful. Tim Ferris has booked the four hour work week absolutely incredible resource of just thinking about entrepreneurship there's a website called Indy Hackers that has interviews with founders of successful internet businesses they've got about a hundred podcasts episodes so far each of those are amazing they're all incredibly inspiring and you can learn a lot from these people there's a guy called Paul Graham he's a partner at Y Combinator that's like the Ivy League of Starship Accelerators in America he's written a ton of essays on his website about how to get start-up ideas how to start your own startup Seth Godin has a podcast called Startup School Y Combinator has a podcast and also has a Startup School series of videos there's so much stuff out there for for us to learn about entrepreneurship in business that it's kind of like trying to be a doctor without understanding anatomy and physiology like you know it's it's kind of the basics you probably should understand the basic literature and then you know you can go off and do what you want but there's so much stuff out there that we should definitely be standing on the shoulders of giants before we're kind of taking the plunge into entrepreneurship. Thirdly if you're thinking of starting a business it's incredibly useful to at least know the basics of how to code and this is for two main reasons so firstly knowing how to code opens your mind up to potential business ideas like it's it's common startup advice that the best way to come up with startup or business ideas is not to sit down with your friends and brainstorm startup ideas but it's to identify problems that you have in your life day to day that you might be able to solve by creating a business or creating product and if you know how to code you kind of know the realms of possibility like you know what can be done and so if let's say you're a doctor and you're working in healthcare and you discover some inefficiency or you know you're a student and you discover something that everyone's doing that could be done better just the fact that you know how to code means that you'll be discovering these possibilities a lot more than someone who doesn't and secondly knowing how to code is really helpful because then when you have an idea let's say you know your marks like a book and you have the idea for Facebook or you're me and you have the idea for that you know running these courses you can then just turn it into a business by yourself without needing to rely on bringing someone else in who knows how to code so for example with six met if I didn't know how to make a website our course would have had 12 people at the local mosque in South Anon Sea and that would have been the end of it but just this this ability of like to create a website is what allowed it to become a national and then later international business just like knowing how to code is so so helpful for that and if you are interested in learning how to code there is a fantastic computer science fundamentals course over at brilliant.org it takes you through the basic principles of algorithms computers and programs and it guides you through interesting and fun little problems along the way to help solidify your understanding of these core concepts and after you've gone through that you can go through their programming with Python course a Python is the world's most popular programming language and you can do pretty much anything with Python from building a simple website all the way through to writing machine learning algorithms if you're into this whole one-spinnership thing and you're interested in learning how to code and highly recommend you head over to brilliant.org forward slash and the first 200 people to visit that link will get 20% of a premium subscription so yeah huge thank you to brilliant for sponsoring this video and let's move on to the next point. Fourthly and on a related note it's also really useful to kind of develop a taste for design and develop a taste for what looks pretty and how to make stuff look pretty and this ability to make stuff look pretty is an absolute superpower in the world that we live in today just taking the example of six med the business you know a bit a big part of why it was successful initially even though we were competing against the big names in the market was just because our website looked pretty it looked legit I've been doing web design for ages I knew how to make a pretty looking website and at the time in like 2012 2013 it wasn't as easy for just anyone to make a website with square space or weeks or whatever and like in my life personally it's not just six med the business that's benefited from my design background it's pretty much everything everything else I've ever done so for example within medicine I've given presentations at conferences and I've won those you know I've won prizes for those and the feedback has been oh your your poster presentation looked really good I've attended these like medical hackathons wait like programming competitions where you build something and pitch it to judges and like three of them that I attended we ended up winning first prize and I think a big part of that was because our powerpoint presentation just looked prettier than everyone else's I even got invited to join the board of this like international plastic surgery charity that does reconstructive surgery missions abroad and that was because they had a website I offered my services I was like hey I can make your website look a bit prettier and they were like sure come on board and that gave me access to this network of amazing plastic surgeons that I wouldn't have otherwise had contact with and then also this YouTube channel like you know the thumbnails have a similar design I think they look kind of pretty I think the production value of these videos is quite reasonable that ability to add production value to everything that you do is an amazing superpower that benefits everything you do in life not just in business and so yeah if you're if you're sold on that and you want to teach yourself the basics of design I'd recommend installing a browser extension called musley and what that does is that it replaces your new tab you know on chrome or safari with like web design inspiration or some interesting typography or graphic design examples used to be a source of procrastination for me to just browse web design inspiration and then as I discover things I'd bookmark them and then over time as you become exposed to good design you develop a taste for it and so when you're then making your own stuff making your own website or making your own posters or even just you know generating a flyer for some event that you're running at your local Moscow church or whatever then you just have the ability to make it look pretty and just that ability to make it look pretty adds adds so much point number five I think it's really helpful to work with friends so there's that classic state of saying in startups or whatever that if you want to go fast you should go alone but if you want to go far you should go together and I think that's really important but also especially if you're a student it's just actually even if you're not a student it's just so much more fun when you're building a business like doing stuff with your friends it's just like an amazing experience like I kind of like it to going camping like you know you're building your tent and you're like building a fire and all that stuff it's just more enjoyable when you're doing with friends people that you like you've got people helping out with it and yeah you might have to sacrifice a little bit of equity early on but you know at the start people are going to be sacrificing their time they're going to want equity that's absolutely fine given that the whole point of running a business and the whole point of doing anything is really just because we think it's going to make us happier why not make ourselves happier by getting friends involved from day one and that was a thing that I did with six men and really glad I did early on about half of the medics in my college ended up teaching courses for us and we had a team of like 20 25 people all of whom me and the founding people were friends with and I just made like for a really fun environment and although there were challenges and stuff along the way just working with friends makes the whole experience of running a business that much more enjoyable point number six is that you should start off really really small and this is a really important point because whenever we're coming up with ideas for businesses or thinking of starting something it's far too easy to get into this mindset where we keep on adding features are always be amazing if our app had this I'll be cool to add that and then the feature list keeps them growing and eventually we just never end up getting anything out the door because we're too concerned about trying to add new features trying to make the thing better and in the start of world there's this idea of an MVP a minimal viable product which is sort of the smallest version of your product or your app or whatever that you can feasibly get in front of people so you start off really small you build this tiny version you get it out in front of people and then over time using user feedback and stuff you then iterate on the design and you just add more and more features over time and improve the product in small ways and this doesn't even apply just for businesses it also applies to starting any kind of creative endeavor like you know the artist who wants to start off by making their first piece the Mona Lisa isn't going to get anywhere but you know you have your sketchbook you do these little drawings equally for YouTube channels if I had someone like you know a Peter McKinnon video or a Matt DiVella video as my sort of I need to get this good before I release a video I would never have ended up releasing anything at all and the thing that I told myself really early on was that my first 50 or 100 videos are just going to be absolutely terrible anyway so I might as well just kind of get over that and then I can hopefully work towards making good videos point number seven is do things that don't scale and I think this advice originated from a chap called Paul Graham who is one of the partners at White Combinator that I mentioned earlier and I'll link the essay in which he talks about this where he gives loads of really good examples but the main idea is that you want to do things that don't scale i.e. at the start you want to be putting an extra effort to make your customers happy to recruit new customers all that stuff famous example the guys who founded Airbnb initially in their first 30 day period where you know it was a bit sort of touch and go no one really knew what was going to happen they physically went door to door in New York to all the Airbnb listings and they offered to take professional photos for those listings for free and that's the sort of thing that you know obviously they just can't do anymore because they're not millions of people using Airbnb but at the start it was that physical effort that was needed to be put in by the founders in order to make you know the snowballs start to roll equally those are company called woofoo that's doing very well for their first few years they sent handwritten physical thank you cards to each of their customers and it's just it's hard to imagine a company doing that in this day and age but if you're starting a startup and you can put in the extra physical effort of delighting your customers and recruiting additional customers initially then you're well on your way to success and I've read about all the stories so when we started six med what I did was for the first couple of years whenever we'd get a new order in I would email them personally and say hey look you know thanks for signing up to our course this is a bit about who I am this is our team we've got loads of expertise among stars if you have any question at all about the medicine application process about your A-levels about studying about anything just reply to this email and we will get back to you and we had lots of customers being like oh wow I didn't realize you guys were you know so like personable that general vibe do things that don't scale as poor Graham says put in the effort to delight your customers your students whatever early on and hopefully that'll lead to rewards further down the line and plus you know ideally we'd continue to have this attitude of delighting our customers as our business is growing all right point number eight expect failure because chances are your startup is as good as gonna fail but you know the stats like 80% of them do 80% of the ones that do succeed are not around in five ten years time essentially chances are very very unlikely that your thing will go well and in fact I had five failed businesses that I tried to start up while I was in secondary school or high school if you're American five failed businesses me and my friend James each year would come out with a new plan to make money and it would fail every single time and it was the sixth one that was this idea for the BMAT crash course and that was eventually the thing that blossomed into six men and that you know made a massive difference to my life but the point I want to make is that each time you fail it's actually you know it's that classically she failure is just a learning opportunity had I not gone through those five failures beforehand you know if I'd given up after the first one I wouldn't have known how to code in PHP I wouldn't have known how to make websites I wouldn't have known what goes into accepting payments online any of this sort of stuff it was going through those failures that ultimately led to the success and the nice thing about starting a business as well is that you don't really have any startup capital and any startup costs these days especially if you're starting an internet business you know for a few dollars you can get a website domain get web hosting and start accepting credit card payments online literally immediately so in a weekend and by spending maybe ten twenty dollars you've got this whole setup and you can build your online business based on that so your costs are essentially zero and the potential upside is absolutely massive again that are referenced to indie hackers that website I mentioned earlier they've got loads of interviews on their podcast of people like you and me who have set up websites or apps or whatever from their bedrooms for practically zero money who are then making tens of thousands of dollars a month further down the line if you treat it as a learning opportunity don't be too put out if your thing fails because it's not really a failure it's you know you've learned stuff and then that'll set you up for success further down the line point number nine and this is something that I try to tell myself a lot is that we should always ask ourselves why we're really doing it so you know it's it's easy enough to get caught up in the hypervite and once you start a business and it's growing it's it's all very exciting but then like for me it was about 26 2016 around the point where our revenue started to sort of stagnate decline a little bit and then more competitors came into the market and then I was kind of thinking oh damn you know I have to put in all this work but I'm not really enjoying running this business anymore and then I came across a fantastic book by an amazing chap called Derek Sivers and that book is called anything you want 40 lessons for a new kind of entrepreneur and I featured that in one of my videos three books that changed my life because this book really did change my life and in this book he he talks about it's it's very short it takes about 20 minutes to read but he talks about lessons for entrepreneurs kind of like this video but just much better he's talking about lessons for entrepreneurs that that he gained from selling a per company called CD baby and then selling it eventually for 22 million dollars and there's a quote in it which is probably my favorite quote of all time and that's a quote that I remind myself off whenever I'm feeling down or whenever I'm you know too focused on the numbers never forget why you're really doing what you're doing are you helping people are they happy are you happy are you profitable isn't that enough and this is just like an absolutely amazing philosophy that you know the only reason we run businesses is because we think it's going to make us happy and it'll help people so if we're happy running it and we're helping people and we're profitable like we're not losing money then why does it matter what the numbers are why does it matter what a growth rate is why does it matter what are retained earnings is percentage of growth or whatever all this stuff it doesn't matter you know as long as we're enjoying it as long as they're having fun as long as we're helping people and I think that's a really important thing to remind ourselves and especially you know with even with things like YouTube anytime I start to get too focused on the numbers like oh that video only got 20 000 views I was hoping it would get 70 000 views like it's just such a pointless game to play this is still fun I'm having a good time hopefully helping out people and that's all that's really needed and finally point number 10 is just start if you're interested in entrepreneurship if you've gone through this really long video so far on your at this point you probably don't really need any more information you don't need more knowledge before you start something even if you don't know how to code just like get an idea and start working on it and then you can learn the stuff you need to know as you go along people liken it to you know the analogy of you know like going to the gym like people don't get ripped by reading about going to the gym or reading about workouts they get ripped by you know putting in consistent effort and turning up and eating healthily over a very long period of time is the same in anything in life it's the same in startups entrepreneurs business so much so that it's become such a cliche that you get these waterpreneurs who read everything and consume all the all the products and all the information about entrepreneurship and yet never actually start something so yeah it's good to stand on the shoulders of giants it's good to listen to Tim Ferriss and read his book and listen to Indy Hackers and watch all the Y combination stuff but don't think that that's a substitute for actually doing your own thing because when you start that is when you really start to learn and then you can apply all the lessons you're learning from this stuff as you're going along so those were my 10 top tips for budding entrepreneurs I hope you found that useful I'll put loads of links in the video description to podcasts interviews articles books etc that I've personally found helpful but the point I want to make ultimately is that you should just start like if you're thinking of starting a business and you and you've gotten to this point in the video just go for it I promise you it'll be an incredible experience and it will change your life so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye bye"
